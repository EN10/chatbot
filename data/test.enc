Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Why?
You got something on your mind?
You have my word.  As a gentleman
Sure have.
She's not a...
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Well, no...
The "real you".
Did you change your hair?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Great
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
Patrick -- is that- a.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
I'm missing something.
So -- which Dakota you from?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
You know French?
What makes you think he'll do it?
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
Will Bogey get bent?
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Hey -- do you mind?
Two legs, nice rack...
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Who's that?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
Have you seen him?
You hate me don't you?
You're not a big talker, are you?
I say, do what you wanna do.
You don't care if I die
Wholesome.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Yes
State trooper?
Answer the question, Patrick
It's just something I had.  You know
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
What plan?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Have a great time, honey!
Did I have anything to say about it?
He's the devil's child...
We should have seen land.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Are we going to argue?
Can't you stay with us a little?
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
May I ask by whom?
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I want to go with you!
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
To bring the word of God.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
Esdras is a Jew.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
How long?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
New worlds create new people.
The ocean is uncrossable?
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
We're lost!
You bloody...
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Your mother was blind?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Now I become custody of police department?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
A cop?
Who did cause and origin?
Chief - mind if I take her?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
What's he looking for?
You know what that is, right?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
What would you call her?
You thirsty?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Yeah.
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Alright.
Stop it.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
You promise?
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Hi, I'm Honey.
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
We are both from Prague.
Did you hear what I said?
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
It's easy to learn.
Robert...?
Viewer discretion advised!
Well, he...
Yes...he's my friend.
A cheap hotel.
What was that?
You okay?
Yeah?  What kind?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
How was it?
What are you gonna do?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Really.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Yes, I thought so.
Good morning. How's it going?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
CONTINUED
When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
And your charming little daughter?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Thank you.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Hey, what about me?
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
You here to write my life story?
Bullshit.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
Yeah.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Last night.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the goddamn car?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
What?
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
What about Luther?
We missed.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
It's late, they're closing...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah...
What the bell happened?
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Who are all these?
You look awful.
Doesn't look like it.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
What am I wanted for?
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
We got a lot to talk about.
You chickenshit punk...
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
What're you laughing about?
...would you like a drink?
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Leeloo's in trouble?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
What's she doing?
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Leeloo... is... she's...
Do you love her?
At least, the cat comes back.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
...Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
...What's your name?
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Yeah?
I'm sorry..
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I'm not going.
Uh...
Where you going?
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
...Like love...
Not going to open?
This is all that survived?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Drink!
How's the detective business?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
Who are you calling?
What are these?
Snuff?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
A fellow investor.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
I want to watch you work.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You brought the money?
What are these for?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
You're a dead man.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
What's he talking about?
Who is Machine?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
You got absolute zero.
Do it.
I never killed anyone.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Give me the film.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Not quite.
How much do you make now?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Who is he?
What's next?
What's this?
Pittsburgh?
He succeeded.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
I'm not positive this means anything.
Okay.
Hello?
How are you?  Having any luck?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
Yes... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
What was she running from?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Her belongings?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Rick...I can't.
Alice, you think you can leave?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
No...
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
How long have you been awake?
Not really.
Here we are.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
So?
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What's wrong with me?
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I gotta get out of here.
Hey...wake up.
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
About him?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
Where are we going?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
You disappointed in me?
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Are you alright?
What?
But how are we gonna --
He sure loves to stay awake.
Mark, are you okay?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
It's okay.
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
I don't know.
Reef!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
We're stuck tight!
I think you're right.
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Dave - !
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Excuse me, Skipper---
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
Why?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
See what?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Are you alright, Wade?
No.
I plan to. Soon.
This spring.
Oh.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
We bought you.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Guaranteed, eh?
If you get it?
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
This way.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
What then?
Jesus, why?
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Huh?
What do I have to do for it?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
Good. Who?
You okay?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
Going somewhere, Margie?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Hold on!
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Something about my father?
You talked to Jack?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Just do it.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Rolfe.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Find them everywhere. 
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Daddy...
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
It's cut.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Can we do that?
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Who did this?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
You're pointing a gun at me.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Four...
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Twenty minutes?
Finally, we can bargain.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
I'll not going without my family.
May I speak to you for a moment?
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
How did your speech go?
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
and if that means negotiating...
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Forget it.  I was reading.
Shut down accelerators.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
It's got to be stopped!
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Elaine!
Are you afraid?
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Can I hold him?
He's a boy dog.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
You can't go in there!
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
You've been hurt.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Both pilots!
Surely you can't be serious.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Elaine!
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
See them, Elaine?
We'd better get back now.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
We have clearance, Clarence.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
What is wrong?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What is this?
Tell me.
Yeah... I know the routine.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
I'm going home.
Stop the car.
What was that about?
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
How potent?
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Movement!
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
And it's too late to shut it down?
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
Now, wait a second --
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
So.
I told them to fall back...
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
What's the question?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They cut the power.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Burke!  Open the door!
Come on.  Crawl faster.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Why not?
What's that?
What?
No, she's fine.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
What is it?
That's stupid.
No!
Yes.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Give me one reason I can understand.
Why not?
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Originals?
It is miraculous.
Alone.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
What are you doing here?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Where's our friend?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
It couldn't be better.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Opera? Opera!
That's right.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
What?
Yes.
No.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
Mio caro Adone.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
But what is it they don't like?
How long will you give me?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
I do.
Are you ill?
Would you? Actually, you could.
Do you have me?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Exactly. A dance.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Herr Mozart -
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
What do you want?
I do not seek forgiveness.
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Oh my son, my poor son!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Where?
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
I'll call tomorrow.
How did he look?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
He's not?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Dr. Hirsch?
Could you get here without any trouble?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
What shall we do?
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Aw come on, Alex!
Call me David.
How old are you?
How old are you?
That's easy enough.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
What?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Closet.
Bathroom.
Alex?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
But...
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
There were witnesses?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
I really don't know.
Well, I like it here.
Right.
Beware the moon?
Heathcliffe.
No, but he was on the moors.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Thanks a lot.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
It's you, David.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Hi, Jack.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
I could hang myself.
No, thank you, Doctor.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Sorry, love.
Do you have any hot soup?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Oscar, what's the matter?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
He has?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I—
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Oh!
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Fifty thousand dollars!
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Doesn't that come next?
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
What's this?
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Yes?
It's all right. Thanks.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
What time did this thing happen?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Hello, Helen!
What did you do with it?
The ten dollars.
No.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's keeping you?
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
This is healing?
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
We got a problem here, brother?
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What?
How?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Beautiful.
A bad idea.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Where'd you get all these riders?
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
I think one of 'em's glass.
The safe. Now.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Where the hell were you?
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Such as?
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
That he was.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Yep.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Hmm.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Now let's have a drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
Really?
Not at all.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Really!
Just perfect.
With my money!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
You wouldn't have done that?
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
J&B. Straight.
This is Dorsia?
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Pull out, goddamnit!
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Patrick?
He's good-looking.
Listen, what about dinner?
Doesn't he live here?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What...is...it?
That's Paul Owen.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
Dorsia, yes?
I said we are totally booked.
Late?
Oh? And what should I say?
Yes?
You don't like this, I take it?
Jean?
Anywhere you want?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Just...say...no!
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
How old are you?
Nice. Very nice.
Yeah...Yale thing.
Don't you know this?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Actually, yes.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
That's so typical, isn't it?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
I mean they want to get caught.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Speak up. Come on.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Hey, Halberstam?
You think so?
Is it over?
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
It's important.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
I can't just walk away!
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
That was -- different.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
You look beautiful.
...What?
Milo?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
You're living here?
Okay.
That's gotta kill him, right?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Who's that?
...Hello?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
It's okay. Really.
Did you?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
I'm okay. It's going well!
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Gary, I --
Ready for number three?
Just thought his work should go on.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
...You wanna work -- here?
Come with me.
I snuck into #21.
He's out of prison?
Do we post it on the Net?
Why were you so careless?
Why were you snooping in my office?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Does he know you know?
Bring it to the other location.
Latitude 47 degrees.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
Did you tell Alice?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
That kid's the great white hope.
Come in.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Hungry.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Be careful.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
My mother's told me all about you.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Let's go get him!
We can't just sit here, Austin.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
No, did you use a condom?
What do we do now?
It says here, name Danger Powers.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Ow! You shot me!
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
How's Austin?
What about his teeth?
What do you want to do, Scott?
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... death ...
Secret ...
Then you can't come in.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
How curious ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
What are you trying to do to me?
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
You.
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
The result would be ...
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Steed, we really must be --
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
No thanks.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Not quite. This is my field.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Is that what you think?
Was I?
You followed me.
I thought you played by the rules.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
I told Mother I took care of you.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Our chaperon.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Privately owned by ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Oh, hello ...
Why?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
The last one you'll ever see.
One shot -- for emergencies.
Does Cole know about this?
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
What do you mean?
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
What?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I've decided not to run for President.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Cole...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
I love that car.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Hello?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
What are we having?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Are you okay?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Your whores never showed up.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
You want to share it?
Are any of those right?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Feel free.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
Ed... you're kinky!
Where'd she go?
Under the table!
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Who was that?
What's this?
He look familiar?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Reach out and snort someone.
You're late again, Rick.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
-- He killed people --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Sheep don't count.
Ya love it, probie?
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Thanks.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
How do you know?
Anything else?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Huh.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Arson.
I could use a date.
Okay.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I'll see ya around, huh?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
I want another shot, Sir.
I need another one, sir.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Just wondering.
So what do you want me to do?
Your brother was a good man.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
I have a job.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
We gotta roll, Stevie...
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
He treats you okay?
I treated you better.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
-- Burn them.
Got a cause?
I'm a little busy right now --
Yeah.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
Large?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
He gots to be did.
Let's go niggers!
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm out.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
Nice to meet you.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
My tap shoes.
I would like to change your name.
You're now Mantan.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Yep, you guessed it.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Go away, unless you got my money.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Let's get him over to the bed.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
He never showed it.
Manray!
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
You okay?
What is your problem?
This is the group I was telling you about.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Thanks.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Peerless, your father called.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
No.
You know how your Daddy is.
How did you get this gig?
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
You sing and dance?
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Money and nothing else?
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
To come back to our roots.
Not her, the one with the little...
I heard ya lady is wild.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
...not that time...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
So what's up with you?
What else?
And?
Where are you bound for?
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
For whom else have you worked?
I believe they will deport you.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
No.
Not even that.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I feel the ribbon.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Does this assignment interest you?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
May I be quite frank with you?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Dark Valdez.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
West was one thing, but this --
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Yeah, right...
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You smoke, Ray?
That'd be my reaction too --
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I apologize --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
He said he worked there --
Where?
Back up.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
What do you mean, West's?
Where have you been, Jay?
Right?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
How are you?
That bad?
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
He's in interrogation?
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Something like that. You?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
Why do you care?
Little bit.
What?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
That's a fantastic idea --
So what now?
No.
Do I have a choice in this?
He was your friend.
I don't think I want to hear this --
We just want --
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Dunbar says you were.
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
It won't work --
Thank God...
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
So?
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
See! The big guy likes it.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Or are you too scared?
Can I see him?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
So I've heard.
It's okay, just leave it.
I'll...
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Okay.
Jesus Christ.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
Where are we headed?
It's unbelievable.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
How can I convince you to stop?
Were you and my father having an affair?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
It's bad.
You need to go.
You never told me how your parents met.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
That really happened?
Mom?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
Yeah it was okay.
It's enough isn't it?
What's this?
You can see why it's sensitive?
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
No.
So?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Syevodnya?
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I don't want to know.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Oh Jesus.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
I don't hate you.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You don't understand me.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
I'm sorry.
You know you can come under the blanket.
You have excellent English.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Hey.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Holy shit.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
You gonna steal my truck?
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
YOU SHUT UP!
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
How you let men treat ya like they do?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I know that.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Keep the change on that.
So...  That your first time?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
What?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
I think she got to you, pappy.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
What's this?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Nick, have I been a good partner?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Getting very weird.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
She disappeared... shit!
You can't come in.  They don't want --
I'm not drunk...
Nick --
What's in the box?
How many men?
Joyce?
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
She ever pull down her shades?
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
We're in?
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
She's such a long way home for you.
This is my stop.
Could you fill me in?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
With these?
If I say no?
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
Would you like to be modified?
I want more life, fucker.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Why are you staring at us?
We have a lot in common.
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
When might that be?
You equipped for random questions?
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Next.
Thank you very much.
How long you had these guys?
Money?
Let's hear it.
Nerves of steel.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
What the fuck for?
It's a good job.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Why not?
How come you're not on the job?
How are you doing?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
But then how can you...
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
Thanks.
May I ask a personal question?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
What about friends?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
My office.
How do you do?
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Where are we going?
Right.
Again.
It was amazing.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Nope.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
How's that?
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I can't, it's yours.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
See, ya.
What?
What's fair?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
This is for me.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
They're all divorced?
Get out!
Yes!
May I please be excused?
The what?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I thought I was here to meet women.
I like her.
What about her?
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I know...and I'm really sorry.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
...I do.
Is this because of the radiation?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
These are wonderful.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Well, do we just go on up?!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
But, I don't understand.
You're sure?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
You have very nice ceilings.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
And thanks for always being happy!
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
You don't look thirty-five.
The sky?  Where?
Whatcha looking at?
Yes?
Well, where are you --
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
He drank it hot?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
You hear that?!
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
How long will we have to stay down here?
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Thirty -five years!
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Is there a problem?
No.  I think it's just right.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Should we say a little prayer first?
I want him to at least see the sky!
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
You came back for these?
I see "elegant."
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
What's it to you?!
To bed?
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What do you want to do with it?
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
Yeah! That's thinking.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Why do you do it?
You're all through with this now?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
No. What is happening?
Don't say that.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Yes.
Yes. Frank--
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
You like to open me, don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You what?
Yes.
I'll call you.
Bull.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hey? You like to walk.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
What time are visiting hours?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
No.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So, what's next?
Yes. I do.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Who, me? Why should it?
Okay, okay.
Jeffrey? Why?
You worry about me really?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Just for him?
Up where?
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
Yes sir.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
What the fuck are you doing?
Shit.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Hey Murphy?
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
I'm serious.
Is that right, Rambo?
Nervous?
Where the fuck are you going?
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
Now, you will receive us.
Yeah?
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
And number three, Dolly.
So, what do we do now?
What?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
The Greeks. The Italians.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
What the...?
Oh my god!
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
What are you serious?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
What is it my son?
Yes.
I guess not.
You're right.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Forgive me father.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
She's really kind of hot.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Where are you going?
Did you see that?
Is it back in?
Loop around real fast.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Yeah.
What's wrong with him?
Yes, they are.
May I have a word with you, please?
What the fuck is going on here?
They don't?
Which one was that?
See, now we've got a plan.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
He's gone. He stole the car.
When'd he tell you?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I had to give some to Inez.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
When'd you get back?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
You could give somebody a concussion.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Shit, Dignan.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
We all set?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Help me move him.
Who tripped the alarm?
You're living on a sailboat?
So how is it in there? 
What's he in for?
That's a sharp jacket.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Absolutely.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Where you going?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Was Future Man adopted?
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
It's in the driveway.
What?  What?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Yeah.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
What?
Are you a fag?
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
What did I say?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I think we might of scared her.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
What happened?
This is natural.
Did we get it?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
You really think he'll remember you?
Way to go, Bob!
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
You can go first, Bob.
The weed.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
What do you mean get back?
Bob, that makes no sense.
Everything OK?
Applejack drove.
Do you have your own room?
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
How long do you have to go?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Where did he go?
Where is he? Where is Rob?
I don't know.
What?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
That's not gonna fly.
Let's talk about Conklin.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
You don't know what you're getting into here.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sorry to wake you.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
Because you're afraid!
I emptied it.
Front. Use your teeth.
So why didn't you kill me then?
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
It's just a nightmare.
No... How?
But we were so careful.
But you're sure?
Where --
-- where's left to go? --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Abbott?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Who?
Okay, Jason, your move.
We need to get in there.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
Show me.
This is everything? Is there.
How long have you worked for the agency?
Amnesia?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Let's give him half an hour.
Anything?
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
Does anyone know his politics?
Longshanks promised!
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Rest, William.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
I have faced him. Have you?
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Anything.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
No dances, just tell me.
We're gonna be late again.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Please, mom. People will talk.
Why do you ask?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I found these. The others are still in storage.
What does that mean for Evan?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Are you hurting her?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Ouch.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Ha! Where's that?
What's happened to you?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I just thought you should know.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Is something the matter?
Then you think it might have worked out?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
And you are...?
So what's the point?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
What?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Here you go, buddy.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Monsieur Rick?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
How long have you been married?
And you want to know --
Nobody ever loved me that much.
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Yes?
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
I don't know the finish yet.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
But why my name, Richard?
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Where is Rick?
Does he always leave so early?
Goodnight.
Did he give any reason?
Ask me?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Your work.
Good morning.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Well, this might come in handy.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
No. It's all arranged.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
And that is?
Even in Berlin.
For the time being.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Ho, diplomatist!
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
You're late.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I have. Sit down over there.
Give me another.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
He'll double what I pay you.
Boss!
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
You ever going to bed?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
What's that you're playing?
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
It's bad.
Can't.  Need water.
No.
No.
You're putting off the inevitable.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
What's so damn funny?
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
What brings you out to the sticks?
You?  Personally?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Four four.  A record.
"We're" not over-reacting.
That's your dog.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
If I'd known you were alive --
Her name's Hannah.
What's that?
What was inside?
So simple to say, so hard to do.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
If you say you are.
Yes, yes he did.
But chickens?
What happened to your pants?
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
When'd you start working here?
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
Kamal is not here.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
You what?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
You fucked us over.
And never take.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Hello?
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
I beat the odds!
How about we go somewhere else?
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
Thanks.  For everything.
May I ask, where are you bound?
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
He'll need clothes... some money...
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I mean your parents.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
What'd she die of?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
How many months are you?
I know.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
And what did she die of, exactly?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I *know* this was right.
*What* will be okay?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
Please don't make me say it again.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
"...did." Well, okay.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
I'm okay--I can walk.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
It's almost like flying.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
What's that? What's it called?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
I'm stayin', Homer.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
First pregnancy?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Do you like to read?
That's *it*?
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
I told him that you all is sick.
Where do you think you're going?
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
We had to finalize the deal.
What's this?
Let's just slow down for a second...
Ten percent. Of how much?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
Ten is standard, sir.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
How much we going after?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
She up for this?
You'll be there?
I guess it lacks a certain style.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Why?
Listen, Scooter --
Come here. Feel this.
Come on. Harder.
Sorry, I --
I don't trust anyone.
He's gone.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
How do you deal with --
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
What about...
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
Why?
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
What do we do? We change the scam?
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
King ain't gonna like this.
What'd he say?
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Stand up.
What happened?
Pretty much.
Can't say.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Just a tip.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Speak.
Who?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You trust this Moonan guy?
I'm Bella.
My car's in the garage.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Ouch.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What?!
All right. As what?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You really are a beautiful woman.
How did it go?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
What?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I didn't.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I want you to forget what I said.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where to?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
And the girls?
What happened to Bella?
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
You use two alternating, don't you?
Where's the magnet?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
You can start Monday week.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Thanks for the information.
How do you feel, Jack?
What's he doin'?
What was that, I didn't hear...
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Do you remember the detonation time?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
You are false data.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
It is intuitively obvious.
That's it.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
So if you detonate in...
Yes.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Wha?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
What's that, sir?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Can I say something in my defense?
What is it?
Same old story.  Not interested.
I'll make it worth your while.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
How'd you find me?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Is the social studies class over for today?
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
The other one like you...
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
What's this?
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
As long as you're okay.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
A little what?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Please...
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
And she bought that?
She's got my word.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Right, the big one-oh.
Hey, Sketchy--
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
A toy?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
She was the one--
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Whoa... she is a killer.
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Namely?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Uh... dudes?
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
No... You don't think...?
Could be.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Dude, this is all I got.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
It was stolen!
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
No.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
I did it! I did it! We won!
Simplicity, Hawk.
But we took the keys?
What do you want?
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Is that your final answer?
Dr. Monnitoff?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
How can you do that?
Who is... we?
I want to show you something.
Why do they call you Frank?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
How old is Grandma Death?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Hey...
Wanna walk me home?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
What happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
That's alright... I understand.
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
Hey.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Know what?
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Who is Frank?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
What's "Cellar Door"?
So, I met a new friend.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
What else do you think about during school?
Who is the boss?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
That I did it again.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
When will this happen?
What's her name?
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Christ. Is that an axe?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Where is she?!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Oh shit!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
And the bite marks on my ears?
Hi...
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Okay... well, bye.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
Annette, just use your hand.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Okay?
Dakota.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
What!
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
Yes -- why?
Have you got a license?
That was for you.
I don't wanna work at all.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Why wasn't I insulted?
Then I demand an apology!
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
That's what you think.
Once more! 
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
Oh, Rufus!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
You won't be long?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
What do you mean?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Like this. 
Don't!
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
I want him back!
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Oh yes?
Treves. Well done.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
Good day...!
Oh, no.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Romance!
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Of course! You want out?
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Thank you very much.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Mmmerrick.
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Ohhh...
The Children. Where are your children
Good morning, John.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
You want a dressing bag, John?
You did this for me?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Yes John?
Won't come out, eh?
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Yes sir.  What's that?
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
HE'S GONE!
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Pardon me?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's your fantasy...
WHAT did you say?
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Please! Please! What are those?
Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?
What?
What was she like?
But you LOVED her all the same...
We mustn't let him land!
The second note.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
How do we know this is the way?
No... we don't...
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
A lot of people like our singing.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
He wants to kill US!
Looting and pillaging, eh?
What about the raping?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
What's wrong with making friends?
I... I... KILLED her...
Faster!
Look, the sky is blue...
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
You mean we'd be dead?
That's better.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
No! Let go, Snorri!
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
But HOW?
Look, I bagged it last week.
How did he do that?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Same thing, isn't it?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
For your own sake... For the others... I...
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
It's a tradition.
I must KILL! Kill!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
He drove me mad!
Shut up.
And something to sharpen them with?
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
May I help you?
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
I'm sure you would.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Huckleberry Hound?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Where do you live?
I'm not a stalker.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
What do you want to hear?
Thanks.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
I don't think we're ready.
More?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
There's this guy!
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Happy Birthday.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah.
I told her today I need to end it.
Well, you're married.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
What do we do?
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I wish we did. You married?
Cool.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
I think I should go back.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
What took you so long?
Yeah?
You must have been crazy.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I should maybe talk to you.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
How's the chicken?
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Hi.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Definitely!
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
No way. I can handle this.
He's coming?
Hey.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
And after that?
What do you want, Stan?
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
You made me have an abortion.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Mary. What are you doing here?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Does that help?
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But I don't know how to polka.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
You don't?
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Going north?
You're the best?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
...do you copy?
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
The containment, Second Containment...
Will it work?
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
Coffee.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Do you hear it? Right there.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
What's wrong?
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
What, Justin, what shows you?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Peters is right, no one's here.
I can see the hatch.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
What does it say?
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
Any survivors?
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
Where has it been for the past seven years?
The "Other Place," what is that...?
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
What are you talking about?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Weir is dead.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Do we have enough time for a weld?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Thank you.
Skipper...
Smith, get out of there...
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Everybody okay?
It tastes bad.
Oxygen is not the problem.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Who?
Miller, come in...
I'm on my way, Starck.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
I'll do it --
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Can you see a body?
No. I saw nothing.
He's engaged the override.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
I mean...
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
You look like an eighties rock band.
What are you doing here?
About me? How sweet.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
The shields on the station should protect us.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Reed?... Sue?
No more cracks about how I look.
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
I though we went over this.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
You need to control yourself and think before you --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Then what is it?
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
What are you doing?
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Ben's still out there --
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this?
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Something happened to them, mon.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Dad says you have to get up!
Jeff you have company!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Oh. Hi.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
What's going on?
I would. Yeah.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
How've you been?
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
I paid for it and everything.
I want romance.
Mr. Spicoli?
I couldn't make it in time.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Well, you'll find out next year.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
How about the point?
I think I better take you home.
You keep them.
What's your other question?
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Where's your brother?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Really?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Killed?
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
I want that fucking radio!
You degenerate pig!
WELL? What are your plans?
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
So do we, lady.
The airport is over there!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
We'll meet in three hours?
IS IT CLEAR?!
Well, it don't look pretty.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
We shot a skunk.
Wha?
We'll be food, dickheads!
They're right here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Scared?
Ohhh.
Your parents of relation?
How are you holding up?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
How much you got to see the show?
He's dead.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
They were all over the place.
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
HELP MEEE!
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hey!
Okay, well that's something.
Let's go!
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Get to your cars!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
I admire your strength.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Well... come on.
Frances?  Oh no.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Oh. I mean, good.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
What's up?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
You don't think I'm good enough?
What does Clifford say?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Bye, baby.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Are you... are you hungry?
I'm going back to the hotel.
Oh, Kurt!
Age?
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
What?
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Frances...
Oh no...
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Harry... I met someone.
Serious, huh?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Is that why you did it?
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
What's left of my blood.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
You know something, Harry?
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Frances, You're crazy.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Where to?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Where you goin'?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
I'm not!
But I want to. I'm trying!
You think I got it?
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
How long will you be?
Haven't you heard what I said?
No!
Where are you going?
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Yes...?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
What?
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Huh?
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
It can't be as bad as that.
You're an outcast.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Your crime... as well as mine.
And if I consent?
She's beautiful.
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Must've been a terrible row.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
God took her from us.
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
You make me weak.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Quite a few.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Now you've got him started.
They'll hang him all the same.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Philosophical?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Professor Waldman.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Any particular reason?
Next Friday.
Alice? The others show up?
How come you're leaving?
Filmmaker.
You can only do what you can do.
I'll go check on Brenda.
I wouldn't know.
Thanks.
What is it?
You just had some lucky shots.
Holy shit...
Jack?
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Don't call him.
Looks like a storm.
It's beautiful...
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Twenty-eight.
You like the car?
Why do you want to stop?
What are you gonna do?
Where is the little lady?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Was? As in not anymore?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Then?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Why are you so agitated?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
What did you call me?
You too, preacher?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
About two hours from now.
I'm going for 'em!
What's going on?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Do what?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yeah, we got a bible.
Are you okay?
We have to go back for Daddy!
How many bullets left, kid?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Richard!
They're gonna search the van.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's what you think?
How?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
You could take their head off.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
The woman I saw you with...
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
None at this time, sir.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
Oh, really.
Fine by me, sir!
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
White House boys want a private meeting.
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
You'll think about my offer?
Then I suggest we start there.
Time.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Just a coincidence?
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
At first.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
'Cool?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
O'Neil...
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
What?
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
What are you doing?
He's not going to do it.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Circuits are overloaded.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
Are you okay?
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
Can I use some?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
They didn't make it.
And how should we do that, Sir?
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
Somebody must have seen it.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
What's with the chewing gum?
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I think we should leave now.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Hello?
I understand.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
This is it?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Don't speak, Quellek.
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
And note the sucked in gut.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh my god, It's real.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Hi Brandon.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
What does the Omega 13 do?
But you don't?
What?  Up?
That's It?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
U.... What do you think?
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
No, I'll kill you. .
...The digital conveyor.
It's suicide.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
Oh, they're so cute.
I am SO SICK of being right.
Your last name.
Hi everybody.
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
Hey... Hey where are you going?
There's nobody here. Jason...
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Clenched jaw...
Thank God. Are you okay?
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
You're kidding. When for?
I heard it too.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We.. We lie.
You... You mean Earth?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Weapons storage...
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Former Commander?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Do your best, Tommy...
Oh, right, sorry.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Continue forward, sir?
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Arnold!
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Who is that!?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
What are we going to do?
What's your advice, Alexander?
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
General Lee is detained captain...
The British army, sir!
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
Colonel Reed...
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
You must be very rich.
These supplies...?
Like flowers after the snow melts.
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
But, you do come from a military family?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
Then why are you teaching me...?
They can use their imaginations.
All people have rights!
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
What about him?
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
And that's for the airport.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Where is my nephew?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Karen? You okay?
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
I'm working on a few things.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
I don't know.
Hello? You there?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
That's what I'm doing.
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
You're not looking at me, Harry.
You make movies, huh?
That's it? That's your movie?
Part of it, yeah.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
One of his best parts.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
I had to tell 'em something.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
So you want to know.
One we're producing.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
What's that?
Whatta you think, Chill?
You've been losing.
It's all mine.
We call you a taxi.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
I think it's not horrible.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Yeah?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
You sure?
What took you so long?
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Hm?
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Harry -–
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
North Island, please repeat? Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
Damn mind of it's own.
What day is it?
One more?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
Did you?
Get up.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
How long, then?
How long?
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Bodies're too fresh.
Dodge to Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Could be a fishing boat.
Then why didn't they take it.
Coffee.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
Go on.
What'd you find up there?
She was sailing up north, right?
Are you sure?
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
What happened.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Murphy to Epps.
What?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Greer to Murphy.
Let the buyer beware.
It's funny.
Greer?
Never been more thirsty in my life.
Oh, man.
It's a Noaa buoy.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Can't find the shotgun.
What about the gold?
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Give up?
Maxine.
Are you still looking for a job?
What?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Who is this, Enid?
Did you actually do this painting?
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Are you the one who left that note?
Nothing.
When did I say I hated you?
Oh, hi...
How long have you been up?
Why not?
Okay... I promise.
God, what a bunch of retards...
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Hi.
Why?
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Hi, Al!
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
Does Oomie really like this show?
So what should we do?
Hey - why do you have this?
I want to do him!
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
What's he doing now?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
You're gross.  See that guy?
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Do you want to do something tonight?
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Look, we have to get these...
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Do you want anything?
Wow... finally.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Who does?
Didn't they tell you?
Fine, and how are you?
That's five hundred dollars.
Five hundred.
Do you have any old Indian records?
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Is this one any good?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Every guy has a type!
So is that your boyfriend?
What did you tell that girl?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
Boo!
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
I... I don't think so.
In what way do you mean?
What's the matter?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
I'm just being realistic.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I have no idea - I just want to...
What do you mean?
Let me see the sick.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
What?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Don't much like them.
Finish your tour?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
How lucky we are.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
Everybody has a choice.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
So this is what you do, huh?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
What is it, honey?
Well, good night, Louis.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Should we go?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
From where -- Neptune?
Who was that?
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Is the line sinking?
Rivers of the stuff!
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Who?  Who?  Who?
Who, Ray?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
This is what you do with your spare time?
Did you find anything at Dana's?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
My Fault!
What's your story, Pete?
Are you all right?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Ready?  What is it?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Damn!
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
All right.  What is it?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
What on earth gave you that idea?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
All right.  I'll try.
Where's the Keymaster?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
That's what you told me two days ago!
I should at least have you, don't you think?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
For the gods, spit it out!
What is that... wailing?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
So am I.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
He's very realistic.
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Narcissus!
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Then get a large cash advance.
Before they leave, get gold.
Hello.
Do you want some dinner?
I want to go home.
But could you try?
Where we going?
What is the matter?
And it's all over now.
Yes.
What's the matter?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What?
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I said I think it is.
Well, I want you to leave.
I don't understand --
Why?
Please let me go.
What are you looking for?
Are you going home?
Oh no. He said that.
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Ben!
Ben.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Could I make one phone call first?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Well here's the purse.
I'm putting it on the top step.
I'm putting it here by the door.
I'd rather not.
Where are you?
Where is it?
All right then.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Drink?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
No.
I think I'll go to bed.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
I want to say something first.
Benjamin?
May I have a drink?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Did you get us a room?
I got a single room.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Yes -- I think that would be good.
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Will you bring me a hanger?
Thank you.
On your first time --
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
You're not interested in art?
Do you really want me to?
What?
How do you get out of the house?
Always?
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
At college.
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Don't talk about Elaine.
I have my reasons.
No.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Well, I'm not.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
But it's not.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
How?
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, no.
I do.
I don't know. I want it to be --
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Hello.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Now look -- please --
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Is anything wrong?
The Carlsons' are here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Turn 'em up.
I want to speak --
Need any help?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
He must be very nice.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh!
Reducing?
Too bad.
We'll dance.
That was lovely.
Why?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
And -- and --
Strange man...
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I want to be alone.
What can you see?
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
And?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
So --
Grusinskaya --
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
I can't.
Why?
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
If we could scare up some men to play.
Ready, Kringelein?
I take five hundred.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Is that for me?
Telegrams?
Anyone asked for me?
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Oh, I've got to find it.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
A man might what?
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You're trembling.
Please -- please!
What's the matter?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Do you like me better?
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
You...
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
You're a little too fast.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Miss Flaemm.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Insolent young cub!
Baron!
Oh, no.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
All right.
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
I know you did -- I said you did --
Yes --
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
You're a deep one.
I can't dance tonight --
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
No. No word.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Next week.
What's bluff?
What do you want with her?
Hi, Bobo.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
Motherhood.
You're calling the shots.
You want a drink?
He's a good kid. A salesman.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You know it, Lilly.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Want a look?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
They knocked out my tooth!
Sure.
I tripped over a chair.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
No.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
What?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
There's nothing more to talk about.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Let me see how you did that one.
Roy? It this all we have?
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
What?
Is that right?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
I don't think I need it.
What is it? What's going on?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Where?
Yes.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
Carter.
A dead body?
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No.  Wait for the police.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
He found you, didn't he?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
I can see that.  Why?
Better?
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
What are you looking at?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Look, they're staring right at us.
I have to pee.
What's this?
You're so easy...
Thanks!
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Is Tim there?
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
You've been watching too much TV.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
What should I do?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
God, what's wrong with him?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Halloween.
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
You've created a monster.
Yes?
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Miss me, baby?
I didn't tell you everything.
Huh.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Is Penelope in?
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Anybody home?
Sir?
You were about to ask a question?
Ask it!
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Excellent!
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're supposed to get hurt!
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
What kind of exercise?
No.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Dad--
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
Can I help you, sir?
Eighteen--  and a half.
Like hugging a lamp post.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
Bluh.
What's that all about?
Please--
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
Fish can't feel.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Go on.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I'm going to call the police.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
She's fine.  Please--
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
You've been bitten by bats?
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
It died for your sins.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
With spittle?
I see.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
Was I ever of use?
Don't shoot.
No.
Can't do it.
It was a bitch.
Alice got married again.
For what?
What happened?
Won't you please join our club? Please?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
That goes double for me.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Is Norbert still here?
That's why I'm crying.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
He'd assume we had.
The park!
I'm saying no--and thank you.
It's true.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Phooey.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Yeah.
I just want to ask some questions.
You're still dressed?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
You want a tip?
What do you mean?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Yeah.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
When do we start?
Jesus.
And your wife? Where's she?
Is that the way it was with you?
Neither am I.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
Mast?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
What are you doing here?
Where'd you hear that name?
What happened?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
What you got in mind?
You're talking about real excitement?
Who told you about this?
Where's Ratan?
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Hold it, mister.
What's that?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
You can fuck off, too.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Come again.
How long have you been driving?
Took it?
No.
Check.
And what do you do, my dear?
Eh, no. Thank you.
Eh, no.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Do you sing and dance?
Yes.
But this is my car.
Yearse!
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
No. 
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You look as if you could.
That's a nice teapot.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
What is it?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Oh, my. We're too late.
I think he's following us.
Did Confucius say that?
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Don't you advance on me.
Oh, you weren't scared.
You sure have a way with people.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
It's all right. It's organic.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
I'm getting married.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Oh, is this your father?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Fifteen.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Harold?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
That's right.
The moment of truth.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Frank.
You knew?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
It's coming.
I knew you'd come back.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
I... I had a visitor.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
The box. I need the box.
What?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
They were over here, Professor.
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Do you believe in hell?
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
What are you trying to say?
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Thank you.
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Myers?
What took you so long?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
What was that??
Anything else you --
Well good n-
Are you sure about this?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
You better have that looked at.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Out? Out out?
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
What about you?
Want to buy a bed?
What's happening?
Will you sign for the bed?
Oh.
Lucky man.
The box... you opened it. We came.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Let me alone, will you?
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Please listen to me --
You remember.
No.
You bastard --
I'm brother Frank.
There is going to BE a wedding?
But you said --
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
Julia.
What happened to you?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Maybe we should just leave --
What happened?
What's the problem?
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
Well?
You're done worse.
Julia?
Huh?
Drinking alone.
Plain soda?
You know it's not often I... you know...
Is this your place ?
Why don't you do the same?
You know, you're very beautiful.
You're awake. Good girl.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
You'd like the house.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
He's gone.
Get the fuck out of here.
I won't be able to stand.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Oh no?
I've been better.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What's wrong?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
Not the point.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Yeah.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
My band.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
He's got one!
A couple blocks!  About six!
Anna Moss.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Where's Rob?
What are you talking about?
Uh.  That's me.
Right.  Why?
Is there a difference?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Huh?
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
What's this?
Are you all right?
Rob.
Laura?  Are you okay?
What needs sorting out?
I dunno.
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Sure they are.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I guess I am.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
What do you mean?
When are you going back?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Laura...
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
How?  How were we the same people?
More confident, maybe.
Nothing.
Where?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
So?
Rob here.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Hi, Marie.
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
So so.  Up and down.
Hello?  Anybody there?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
He'd want to know about all this.
You're very macabre.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Good reflexes.
Someone beat you.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
I'd rather hear yours.
What's all that?
You want me to front for you.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
You're using your son's name.
Yes.
There are differences.
Don't.
What is it like?  Being you?
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Be quiet.
Afternoon.
You're not from these parts.
How can you know this?
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
Does it change with me in the room?
It is as you are.
It is the truth.
But we cannot be killed.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
I'm your future husband, remember?
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Something pretty.
Your name?
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Do not turn your back on me.
My father taught me.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
_Answer_ me.
How are you?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
I haven't drunk this much since-
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Friend of yours?
What's the point?
I want you to come to me.
Do you know what this is?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Home.
The resemblance is amazing.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Are you back?
What doing?
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
The five hundred? Sure.
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Hildy!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Did you give her the money?
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Mother? But your mother --
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Anything the matter?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, she'll know some day.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
How long is what?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
What do you mean by that?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
He's in the insurance business.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
You said it.
What tricks would I pull?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
She jumped out of the window.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
All the words you've got.
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Double-crossing swine!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Where is she? Tell me!
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Look at me, Hildy --
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
No!
How was that for a tight squeeze?
In a way.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
What!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Walter!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Let's see the money.
They're always after me for interviews.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
We know what you're up to.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Take your paws off me!
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
He's harmless.
That's murder!
After all I've done for you --
Pete, you're through!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
Shoot to kill, I said.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
And so do I!
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You'll take fifty and like it!
Where's the old lady?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Look out, you --
Have you got my dough?
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Hiding him where?
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Don't talk too loud.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
What's that?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What's the idea?
Are you all right, now?
What's from the Governor?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
How much do you make a week?
Pinkus.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
Here's the picture of my wife.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Get the cops, somebody.
There she is!
What's your hurry?
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
This is going too far, young man.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
I never was.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
You want to join our gang?
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
You couldn't.
Who with?
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Boy, that was some air-raid.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
No Turks.
Has Sue got it right?
You joined up.
And what's that?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
You know it? It must be an old one.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
It seems to have survived.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
What did I do to deserve this?
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
I agree.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Is your brother ready to go?
He left!
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
What the hell are you laughing about?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Come on, bro. Let's go.
What's this?
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
What's he so excited about?
Just grin and bear it.
Should we stop?
Why are we stopping?
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Drive through it!
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
So.
So what?
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Jesus Christ.
God damn.
What'd ya got there?
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Where is he?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Grampa... watch the language.
I don't know. I only saw one.
What should I do?
Hey.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Mr. Willis?
What about the body you found?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Plates match.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Tell him, Harold.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Hello, my little boy.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Oui.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
Hunh.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
My apologies, madam.
Nice night.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
My brother says he likes you, too.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
No. I married a midget.
Rose, please go away.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Shaving cream?
Did you see that?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
What are you doing in there?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
So, how's it going today?
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
How's work?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I think he's ready.
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
You were gone a long time.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
Wait!
Yes.
Pittsburgh?
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
I want to talk to you.
You bastard.
Are you ready for another?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
How much?
Poker's not your game.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
What happened to you anyway?
Thinking about what?
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Fine.
Hey, Findley's here.
How do we stand?
When do I raise the bet?
Please don't get off me now.
Well, here it's half.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
How do you feel?
Go to hell.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Just like that?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
When?
What time?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
What time does the bus leave?
Yeah? What do you do now?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
I'm hungry.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Don't you ever cook anything?
You going out?
Who is it?
You need the words?
No, I want to walk.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Go on back to the hotel.
Where do you come from?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Hundred dollars?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
You name it.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
What about... now?
Yes.
I only protect myself -- !
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
Mine.
I don't know.
Yes.
Shhh... don't talk.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
So, what do you do?
You built things.
Bathroom?
We're going to be moving, son.
Why, Dad?
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
It was so real, Dad.
Where's your car?
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
I have school.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
What do you want?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
What do you want me to do?
Are you all right?
You saved a lot of lives.
What the hell is this?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
What the hell is that?
You try Martin?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Pops, you're a genius!
Thanks, Pops.
What the hell are you doing?
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Where are they?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
It's doing what?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
So, what do you do for a living?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Dad?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Schneider?
Are you expected?
Tapestries?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
You could be more right than you know.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
I usually don't either.
Bingo.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
The Ark of the Covenant.
What's that?
This.
I never expected to see you again.
Dad!
It is you Junior!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Well, what was left of him.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
...you did it.
They want my diary.
No! Don't Shoot!
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
What?
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
What did you get?
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Dad?
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
I like Indiana.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Then we'll die.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
What?
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
Dr. Jones.
What's that?
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
No, the stones are mine!
It is why Krishna brought you here.
I like the service here.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
What'd he say?
What'd he say now?
A what...?
Don't let it curl around you!
Can you move your arm?
What's happening?
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Couldn't keep away, huh?
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
Anymore ideas...?
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
The last Sankara Stone.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
You've heard of U.S.T.?
What are you doing?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Why he's argumentative?
No they won't.
I'll talk to them.
Behind us?
I want out.
Calm Down! Act rational.
Did you hear that?
What do you mean we.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Like the guys that attacked us.
You need ID in there?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What is it?
...and a license to kill...
Eating sushi?
Do you notice anything.
Swim.
Now what?
Eat it?
What is it?
You're beautiful..
What do I do?
Where is she staying?
...Joe.
What happened?
Without your pants.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Now, where would I be?
You really like that shirt?
Mind your own business.
Get close to them.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
I feel like an idiot.
Joe, be careful!
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
She's got the most beautiful...s
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Don't you think I stand out like this.
On what?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Where are you going?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What?
I don't trust her.
It's him.
There's a lot you don't know.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Be quiet.
I have been... I think you're right.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
Sorry...
Doesn't matter.
Nice?
I knew you were trouble.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
We'll have to let them go.
Yes?
...Foreign service.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Your memory.
When you do...
Right.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Joe.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
Not...complaining, actually.
Sue who?
What did you say?
What do you do about what?
I'll be right there.
Dinner...tonight.
Wait. What's your name?
And you?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
You work for Ryuji?
I'm leaving too.
This business is over.
What?
What?
So do I.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
He told me what to do.
Yeah...I have to get away.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Right there.
Mom.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Alright, alright.
Sure.
Do you want more rice?
What are you cooking?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
I'm afraid you are.
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
A gun? Yes.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hello?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
I can take her.
Uh, what are those boxes?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Thank you, Bob.
What's wrong?
What are you and Mike going to do?
I got perspective.
Yeah, I'm here.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
So, is everything okay?
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I disappeared on you?
Give me a break!
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Who's that?
How much would I get paid?
What do...
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
How'd you know that, Lowell?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Jeff...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
No? No, what?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
What are you talking about?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
What do you mean there is no family?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
Object to the form!
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Baby. You are so HOT!
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
No!
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
That's his lawyer.
Objection, your honor!
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
What the hell is Botox?
Why in God's name would I want...?
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
What?
I'm happy for you, pal.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
How nice.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
No.
He's passionate.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
To victory.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Marylin? When did I say...?
She never particularly cared for me.
And here I thought my mother was...
Friends?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I don't have a ring!
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
But?
I have a surprise for you.
You don't like me?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
I don't believe you have "things."
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Hello?
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
I fell in love Miles.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Murder!
Pre-Castro.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Forgery and Fraud?
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Wow.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Lilly's up.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
But you're going through with it?
So what?
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Wait. I know you.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
My client has ruled that out.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Wrigley!
What the hell is wrong with you?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
That's an evasion.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
I might.
Where are you taking me?
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Please don't shout.
I knocked several times.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, come now—
Fine man to fall in love with.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
It's my daughter! Go after her.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You talk as if—
What would you like to have me do?
We've done that already.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
What do you think you're doing!
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Oh, yeah?
I beg your pardon!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
That's right. You didn't.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Who are you?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Where'd you say the showers—and things—were? 
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I better go over and see her.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
You're crazy.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
But what!
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Carrots.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
You! Don't make me laugh.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
—six—seven—eight—nine—
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Yes—if he is your husband.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
But can't you wait until morning—
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
I've been thinking about you.
I'm hungry.
The dame's too smart for him.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Yeah, where am I?
What?
Mush. Mush.
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
What's the idea?
Five G's—or I crab the works.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Did he pay?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Recall any names?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
And Shaw?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
I'm scared.
I want the truth.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
No.  Never heard of him.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Who?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
My sympathies.
Did they live?
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
They killed him, honey.
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
What's wrong, Lou?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
Are they?  Why would they?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
And he never hit you before?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
How many men are working with you on this?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Do you walk home?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
What?
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
And you didn't tell the Police?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
Can I have a word with you?
My pocketbook.
Help us do what?
But now you're telling us now you do.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I'd love one, but not there.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
No, you didn't. What branch?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How'd you feel about it?
Does something else worry you?
Catching a movie.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
How old's Annette?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
The feds. It's evidence.
You're rationalizing.
It'll be more than that.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
I didn't use you, Max.
I thought you were tired of your business?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
You know what we want.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
Uh-huh.
Yes. All those things are true.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
Oh, hi.
Sure.
Killian's.
How long you been with Ordell?
He said he didn't know about it.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You already knew that?
You think I'm kidding?
It looks good on you.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
And what was your answer?
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
I don't know. One of your friends.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
It's boring, isn't it?
Want a hit?
Is it ready to go?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Which one?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
I lived there for about nine months.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Wanna fuck?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Whatcha watchin'?
Guess where I am?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
How can I help you?
Yeah.
It's in my bag.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Getting there.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Hey, Max.
I can see that. Why?
It still sounds high.
Somebody already did.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
You still there?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Well, give it to me then.
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
She was afraid.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
You sure?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
We're back.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
He's around.
Are you all right?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Daddy, what was that noise?
It's cold.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What are you doing?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
I'm not cold.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
What happened to you?
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Yeah, but for what?
And look what I got.
She looked good then.
Ready?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
We're at Della's.
How high is that?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
How come? The army?
While you were in the shower.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Who else were you expecting?
How?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Jake, what is it?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Where have they gone?
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
You got a nice tan, though.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Clear the area. This is an order!
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
Speaking.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Where have you been?!!
We're not supposed to do that.
How many?
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Where is...?
Get them in the lab!
Jesus what the hell is that?
Yllo, what's your head count?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Sergeant!
I'm with you kid.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Give me a break! What happened?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Outta here?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Rizzo?!
You wanna release your air tanks?
Rizzo, you okay?
I...I don't know what I did...
Now that's just gross.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
You're so bossy.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Do I have to?
Kay-Em, you okay?
I missed you too.
I don't understand...what does he want?
What?
How do you know?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Yes!
Guys, he's right behind us!
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
Probably out in the back yard.
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
Be careful.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
How come you have to tell them that?
Home... New York?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Only 24 hours!
Who's that young man?
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
What? What?!
How can you tell?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
This has got to be one big violation...
What's that, a ship?
What day is this?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Leg of lamb this time?
One more after this, then I'm going home.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Hey Bleek.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Jesus, Bleek.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're being really immature.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Wait, let me take that.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
No.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
I rock a Harmony.
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Then what's going on?
What...
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Yeah, like people in love.
Or...
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Touche.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
You don't say.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You guys are playing music?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
You lose!
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
Are you takin' the pictures?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
I'm cool.
What's this?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
That's me.
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Carryin' a gun.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Geez, they look kinda weird.
Yeah but, what is it?
What's wrong with her?
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Tight fit.
This the book your writing?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
...and?
You two been busy in here.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
There's more...
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Any word from that gallery?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
...never?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
...Janitor's job.
What happened?
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
What do you think?
Well, how was it?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
You thirsty?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Yeah. Why you give money.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I'm nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
You know what I want to do?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Dance!
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Your a real philosopher.
Hello.
Did you bleed?
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I'm coming.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Do you know where he went?
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
Yeah.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Hi mom.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
So, how many people live here now?
Yeah.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
It was... it was.
I can't man.
By yourself?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Then let's narrow it down.
The message!  I figured out--
You think he's dirty?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
No shit!
You still having a problem with this?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
A few people.
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
We'll find the evidence.
To get your attention.
Just like who?
How?
What?
What word did you leave last night?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
By that time the game will be over.
Let me speak to my daughter.
Please... wait.
It's me you want.  Not her.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
No problem.  We're in.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
Feeling better?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Why did he?
Come here.
What are you doing up?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You ready?
It isn't Kathy.
How long has she been dead?
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
Answer the question.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
You're always in the middle of a match.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Bainbridge Books.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
What are you looking for?
You sure you don't want to eat something?
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
Do you?
I'm just curious.
Why?
What?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I'm hungry.
Fine.
Peter, you have to admit--
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
How did you know it was "carefully"?
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
We're almost married.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Where is the Fortress?
Take the western passage.
The White Castle has fallen.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
There is no other way.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
You have not slept in two days.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
Can she be forced?
From here, I must go alone.
She must make a glaive.
I can. Because I choose it.
Slayers!
I road them often in my youth.
It is today?
Am I not worth returning to?
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Well, I'm not impressed.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
What is that awful looking place?
Can't I come, too?
A venison pie as big as a house.
My heart stays here.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
Modred! Impossible!
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
She has the power of vision.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
When I say I love you.
...OK.  I love you anyway.
Where are you going?
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Risky business, isn't it?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Salute.
Here comes the resume.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
It's impossible.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
How long does this... Mania last?
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Yes -- you are.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Anything?
No.
Walk with me?
What did they ask?
Doubts?  About what?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Shit!  He jumped!
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
You're walking to California?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Tom Joad?
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Are they standing?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Coffee?
Sparkling apple cider?
Hello!
You're pretty drunk.
Sarah -- with an H?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Don't run away.
Yes.
You OK?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
What do you mean?
Sera you are crazy.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
I'm going to fill it right now.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Thank you, Sera.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
How'd this happen?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Where are you staying?
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Where have you been?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
What alibi?
I loved him!
Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
No!
What's going on?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Where you got in the shower.
Come again?
Huh?
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
You're not going up there.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Yes?
Good one.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
It's not my alibi to tell --
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Here. You're gonna need this.
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Good luck.
Don't ask.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
I can't.
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
You really think I'm attractive?
Whoa -- Why?
So now you're -- ?
Oh, my God!
Almost.
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
You got into Harvard Law?
You look -- nice.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
We come watch... we come watch...
More fun win battle?
You go to lady now?
God protect me.
And you... are you not also afraid?
Like some vile toadstool.
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
You're a beast!
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
No, wait... please... listen...
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
But... but, why?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
Shhhh!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Aye!  That too.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Can we trust him?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Water doesn't burn...
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Will you explain what's going on?
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
A good day for singing...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
I was with the Princess.
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
You see!  You see!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
We seek to undo the curse.
Well done, lad.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Dolt!
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
A gentleman would offer water.
How much longer?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
I have no wife.
So, he's hiding in the dark...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
What's the matter?
Biting you?
Pinching?  Where?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
What became of the princess?
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
No!
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Please...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
The fastest in the world.
Praise be to God.
Where?
Uhm... fine work.
Is he a friend, then?
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Simple as that, eh?
Can you show us the way?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Are you going to see Sam again?
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
What's that for?
I put him to work.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Atonement.
Are you his friend?
Why?
My mother would die.
Where's your dad?
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
I'm coming in.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Josh said...
I was wondering.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
This is such a street of whiners.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I have the permit.
I've been here twenty years.
Maybe...?
Well, I feel better about this now.
I've got one favor to ask.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
I did warn you.
I'm not going!
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
No one would blame me if I left!
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I wish you had told me then.
I gave up on you.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Are you talking?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I still don't know what that means.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
Good for you.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Kurt's been feeding him.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
The garage.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
One of you would end up dead.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
It's not breakfast yet.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
Where's Sam?
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
Peter left me yesterday.
I could die.
Don't move!
He said he heard hammering.
What the fuck?
We've eaten.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
The biggest waste of time since television.
I was talking about our marriage.
Where are the kids?
You don't look like you.
Do you know anything about building a house?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
I brought a few of my own.
Go tell your father we're eating.
No, nigger.
These are free papers.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
She's alright, isn't she?
Why not?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Engagement ring!
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
What are they gonna do to us?
That's some long green.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
My daddy gave me this watch.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
You're soft.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
You know what I'm saying.
What does that mean?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Does that mean I'm in?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
I know people.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
What?!
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't make me take them away from you.
What'd you say?
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
You ever done time before?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
Mama?
What are you doing here, mama?
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Who?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
How did you see me?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Makin' friends already.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
No. This can't be happening.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Bus?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Easy, Liberace.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
What's with that guy?
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Which way did he go?
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Hello.
You got the wrong window again, man.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Yes...
..."The Devil?"...
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
Answer the question!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
That's better.  How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
What's wrong, Available?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
You felt sad. What's your name?
I'm listening.
What Quad do you live in?
You could have called me yourself.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Maybe... sure...
About running, dying what?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
I'm afraid.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
...But I still have the choice...?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
What does that water do?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
What's happenin'?
You okay, man?
Pete... You okay?
Very strange.
No.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
You recognize that guy?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
You like it?
In pornos?
So, should I call Andy?
Set.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Dick Laurent?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Okay. Thanks.
What night is that?
The police called us.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Sheila?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Repeat that, Bill.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
That's not Fred Madison?
When he went to work, right.
Who is it?
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
I won't ever tailgate.
No.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
What's bothering you, Madison?
We've met before, haven't we?
Does it say anything on the tape?
From the club. You didn't answer.
You're up early.
Let's go home.
They're gonna cook him.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Okay.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
What's goin' on?
Why haven't you called me?
Last time I saw you.
You still care about me?
What do you want?
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Hey... Sheila.
Uh-huh.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
No kidding?
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
You mean you don't want to go?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
And the wine - excellent.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Well, it must have taken–
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
108 and still active?
Very often.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
What do you want?
No porters here!!
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Are you taking me?
Sondra Bizet.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
Just what I needed too.
Hurray!
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Oh George, come on.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
George, come back!
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
What's she got to do with it?
Where did you come from?
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
Yes.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
What is?
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Ouch!
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
How about you? Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Thank you.
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Now what?
What's going on, Kay?
Jesus Christ...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Sure.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What the hell does that mean?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Goodwill...
Nowhere.
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Yeah?  What's up?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Wally!
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
No.  Follow him.
Agatha...
Oh, God...
Please, I want to go back...
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
-- but he didn't.
That's not much.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Lara called me.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Uh, sir...
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
The mall?
Confirm with trig and image.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
You set me up...
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I won!
Okay... now let me time you.
Sean -- you're not real.
It's a little late for that.
What the hell.
You're alive?
But you have to.  They said you would.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
What's so funny?
You don't seem all that proud.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
What?
Why?
Why should I trust you?
What safe place is that?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
Which one is that?
John?
This is all my fault.
Who?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
The guy from USA Today is here.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Good God.  What was that?
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
It's the same prevision.
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Can't they shut that off?
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Cream and sugar.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
You know I need to use you.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
I can take you down there.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Women?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I know.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
No.
Hello.
Oh my god. What happened?
You talk to Max today?
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Max offered to stake me.
Whu --
Where is this happening?
How so?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Yes.
You want --
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
I can wait around if you want.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
We're with Ruiz.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Nice work.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Who you calling?
How much was it?
Oh really. Why's that?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
They didn't say an address?
So they said more than the address.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Motherfucker...
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Put that shit out...
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
We need guns.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
It's gonna be fine.
So what do we do?
Three and a half hours?
Dude, we were practically made...
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
What's up, man.
You look good, man.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Excuse me.
You strapped?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
No?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Yeah.
So whenever we want...
Yes. You're going to New York.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Who's gonna outfit us?
Where can I get a hold of you?
I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
Man, what do you want?
You ain't lying.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
The body is a holy repository.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
We need more young warriors like yourself, stick around and we shall see if your heart is true.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Is the program ready?
What points?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
I'm in Detroit.
Did you hear what I said?
Why are you looking at me like that?
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
I assumed...
Let's cancel.
Why don't you just ask your question?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Did you see the papers today?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
And like a fool I believe it.
You know that gal?
She know?
Let's go.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You evil this morning.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
You had the number.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
That ain't bad.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
They talked about me like
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
[Where are you coming from?]
[Senor?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Daniel.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[Who pays you?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[What do you mean?]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
Is it loaded?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
I'm here.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You been working?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Where are you from, Creasy?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
We're taking a different way home.
Hmmm?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Why do you ask?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Could I ask you a question?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
You've done much of this work before?
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Creasy... Wait.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I'll call her up.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Are you kidding?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Who?
When was this?
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
No, Marty, please...
No...
No...
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
You got an elevator in this house?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
What?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Sure. This girl said...
What?
It's loaded with what?
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
So I'll die without a son.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
I said, is she Italian girl?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
On accounta...
Okay.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yes, O'Reilly?
You boys'll have to go to work early.
What are you going to do with him?
Stop him! Stop that man!
Which hospital?
Don't you use olives?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore –  House. You in the market Duke?
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Any time. Whenever we want.
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Radar!
What for?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Look.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
I don't feel anything.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
How did you get called that?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
Our minds?
You're an attractive man.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
He's coming to.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
About that chest-cutter...
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
What's going on? Who started this?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Sir?
Good morning, Colonel.
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Huh?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Oh. Yeah.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Hello?
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
What?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
I can read. I can read!
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
What do they want?
Yeah, Boss?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Who's got him?
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Join the John Doe Club.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
What are you doing up here then?
Is there anything wrong?
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
That's got nothing to do with it!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
Flowers.
Oh!
What do you mean, too bad?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Is there a crowd in the street?
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
No -- you can't do that.
I don't know.
Floor seats.
Where's the stereo?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Don't make do it, Mike.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Tell me what's wrong.
How can I help you with the particles?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
You don't have to come here.
Are you in charge, Roper?
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Recruited you from where?
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You'd never been out of New York?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Where did you hear that?
I can't do that.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
The 6 horse is last.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
How long you been coming here?
There's your answer. He's smart.
What the fuck is going on.
You're crazy.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
And what about the ones you don't save?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Is the hostage injured?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
I worship you.
Hey.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
It's already started.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
When?
There is?
Korda escaped.
Yeah.
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
The hell I am!
Are you going to make this hard for me?
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
What have you promised them?
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
She said I have a son...
But this is impossible.
It's time to wake up.
The maze has been changed --
What's her name?
He had keys.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Who did he digitize?
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
And it meant something.
What's so funny?
Why not?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Program name?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Release the power WITH the power.
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
That's the only way to the Monolith...
NEW POWER COINS!!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Here you go!  No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL!!
... A falcon?
And how do we release the power?
Hey, boss!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
What is THAT!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
The goddamned bastards.
And now you have everything.
When my money moves, I go with it.
I got my partner in there!
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Bastard didn't even show.
You ain't even a man yet.
Inside, they were talking of you.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
I booked passage to London.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
Charlie!
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Meyer.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
How soon can we pull this off?
You bastards, I said twenty!
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Come off it, Bugs.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
I like that.
What the fuck does that mean?
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
What are ya thinkin'?
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Yes?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Best we got.
You're fuckin' crazy.
Special occasion?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
What?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Death! Thank you!
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Sure. Why?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
Stu?
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Don't ask where I got it.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Stu...LOOK!
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Who told you we deal drugs?
You want to come inside?
But I was dusting.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Mother!
Who is it?
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Positively not in the station! Gone!
Tell me why!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
What! Who?
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Diz--
Any time.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
My first name's--Clarissa.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Diz!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Taylor, my dear.
All right, why?
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
One minute! Just one minute!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
*You won't?*
What!
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Washington!
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Well--goodnight.
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Yield *how*, sir?
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Oh, now--
Hello, Jefferson.
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
*No*!
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Committee.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
I know. It's--Violet.
Abigail.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
You--don't know it, do you?
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
Already? All these letters?
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
What are you going to do?
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
What! Who?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
I know that.
What are you talking about? What difference--?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
You can't say *that* to--
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
How nice.
His first 'whiff'!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President...
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Yes.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Since he was born.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Were you present when all these things took place?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You are , aren't you?
Sure. I met you.
Have you seen the papers?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
People have been crucified before.
You're acting like a school girl.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
With pay!
How'd you get the picture?
When're you going to see him again?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Yes, but you said—
You try it.
Gold, eh?
I wish you luck, sir.
We'll send for the police!
Thank heaven.
Relatives of old man Semple.
Miss Bennett please!
It's a lie!
Newspaperman?
Yes?
How do you do.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Will you have a cigar?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Why not?
Let him alone.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Proceed.
Uh-huh.
Brookfield just came in.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
South Dakota - north?
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Dr. Mumford.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
What are you doing for lunch?
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
I have eighteen more minutes!
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
But you know how to drive?
Hiya, Doc.
When did you start to feel this way?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
What would you do?
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Is that when you split up?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
I guess you saw the show...?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
Can I ask you a personal question?
I've got three big ones.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Well, there's Lily.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Who else knows?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Sounds like you have several.
Did you carry a gun?
"Get to know your therapist."
At least you pulled yourself out...
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Lily.
I'm here for you, Doc.
I guess that makes sense.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
Who the hell are these guys?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
And how does one do that?
Oh yes, of course.
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
Where's your new friend?
What just happened?
See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
Fifty percent.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
That "thing" gets me excited.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
You two!
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
It's everybody's problem!
Got guts, lady.
You lied to me!
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
I found it, Evy! I found it
Hey,... don't I know you?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
Um-hmm.
And what's that?
We didn't think this through very well.
Much less go outside.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
Hey... you okay?
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Snap out of it!
Have you considered my offer?
That boy's got talent.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
I'd better go.
Or talk?
Hi.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
It's me.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Bye. 
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
You drink too much.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
What are you talking about?
I'm liking this.
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's a big difference.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
This place is built like a fortress.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
So why don't you just tell her!
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
The who?
Roy --
What's that?
Firepower costs money.
Are you famous?
Wow.
Here you go. 
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
She likes you.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Be a Mohican.
And a social life.
To us!
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
It's time.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
I'm glad you like it.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Please...
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
About 5,000 troops.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
And where is the army?
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Bastia -- and you?
Ah-hh, no.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
Why are you carrying the dog?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
That is correct.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Only Lisette?
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Were you in love with any of them?
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Yes!!
Why did you give it to him?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
What the hell is the matter with you?
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What?
You wrote it.
Do you know what you're saying?
Can you give me a drink, please?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Stretch it out.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Great moves, Day-Day.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Who is that?
Man, this a cool house.
You straight?
Just a little.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
So.
I walked.
What's the matter?
I ain't trying to get in it.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
You see that?
What you see?
You're welcome, Unc.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
You want us to give you a ride?
Delivery!
Can I help you?
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
What it smell like?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
What kind of activity?
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
What is it?
That the big one, huh?
Are they still out there?
Roach, what are you doing?
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Where did Craig move to?
What you say?
Get on.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
What about that ugly dog?
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
All right, I'll do it.
Where'd you come from?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
How do you know that?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
This? I've never even fired one.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
For what?
Can we go now?
You're out of your mind.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Again.
But...
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
Ready?
No. Kisses to you.
Please...
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
What am I supposed to say to her?
Well?
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
I'm looking for them.
That's enough.
What do you figure he done with it?
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Here they come.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
O, she's all right.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Who?
Just went?
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Pearl dotes on him.
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Amen! Amen!
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
Hing, hang, hung.
Why?
Just a man.  Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Don't you hurt her!
Story, honey? Why, what story?
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Tell me what, boy?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What are you doing, boy?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Now it's your turn.
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
Yes; John's bad.
Why, pray tell?
Do you want more children, Willa?
Are you through praying?
Mornin', ladies.
This man down at the Drugstore...
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
What'd you all talk about?
How long's this been going on?
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
What the hell's going on!?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Okay?
The killer.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
You crazy? Hit him with what?
How you doing, pal?
Rod's not a lunatic.
She dreamed this would happen...
Decide to take a day off after all?
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
What's the Coroner got to say?
She lived there.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Who? Who did that?
Get into bed.
Mother, for petesakes.
I must be going nuts...
What's with the bars?
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
Guess I should'n'a done it.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
No.
Do you think I did it?
What the hell you doing here?
Well, here are fifty francs.
And you too, Ninotchka.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
You want this?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
That must be the one!
We had to take it on account of the safe.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
I am, Gaston.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
We can wait.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
We don't want to be disturbed.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
What proposition?
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
Comrade Buljanoff...
A week?
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Is this what you call the "butler"?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
I will start with you.
And what is your profession?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Was that talkative?
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
As a representative of Moscow...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Because we are an odd couple.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
On which boat?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Thursday.
Are we going to build our little house?
Not white, darling.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Would that make you any happier?
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Hello, Leon!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Did I hear something about jewels?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Yes, Swana, you did.
All right, I'll listen.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Cigarette?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
It's just a place for workmen.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
We could check the tape again, sir.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
I understand that, sir.
Is it?
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Why me?
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
What about England?
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Sorry ...
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
About a dozen.
Who?
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Where are they?
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
We could leverage Helms.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
What'd he say?
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
And me? ...
Mr. Castro.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Oh, my goodness ...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
You'll win the nomination.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
We took his system out.
Who do you think is behind it?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
How the fuck did you know?
Where'd you find him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
So, what's this about, Dick?
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
He was a politician.
Yes.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
Where you from?
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
You're not a failure, Dick.
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Dick, don't...
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Yes!
Yes.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
Won or lost?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
What?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Some say you are, Rocky.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
I am older.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Yes ma'am?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
But you don't believe it.
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
How's that, Sheriff?
...This month's checks.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Don't get hurt.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
It ain't even three years we been married.
No.
Llewelyn!
What're you doin', baby?
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
What should I do?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
Yessir?
I can't say.
Where does he work?
Huh? What is...
Mm-hm.
...I know where you are.
All right.
...Me?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
This. And the gas.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
How's that?
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Tent poles.
...Keep going. Don't stop.
I want you to take me to another motel.
November the 28th, last year.
Well enough.
Half.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
I don't mean braze.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Don't jack with me.
How is she?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
You should get the order you want.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Who are these idiots?
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
The LeSabre!
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
I gotta go.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
What was that?
...like the water purifiers?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
Yes.
You're in serious danger!
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Dr. David Ravell.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
What are you doing?
I got this apartment with a guy.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Guess who I saw today.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
What are you doing?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
Could you give us an example?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That is so right.
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
We can live with that.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
We should go.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
What doesn't?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Wesley...
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Isn't that the point?
Seems like a nice place.
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
You lie, motherfucker...
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Huh?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
You can't do this -
It ain't the law!
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
That's right!
...Pete?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Whuhh...
Uh, we uh-
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Them straw polls is ugly.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Mama said you was hit by a train!
That's a maiden name.
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Who gave you this idea?
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Good morning, girls.
Zack, we've got to go.
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
I want to fly, sir!
I want to fly jets, sir!
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
No, sir!
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Vietnam?
What other issue is there, Sid?
Sid, there's no baby.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
How did it go with you guys?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
There's always a choice.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
Want me to get a towel?
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Jets.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
You're welcome.
He said open it.
You should see the look on your face.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
What?  What do you want me to do?
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
-- posed to mean?
Get the fuck away from me.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
They're not supposed to be here!
They're not supposed to be here!
Who is this guy?
They won't get hurt.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
She said she did.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Open it.
Be quiet.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Oh, I've seen these...
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
Damn it!
What do we do?
I heard you.
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Fuck.
YOU HAVE TO!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Where is the Glucogen?
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Those ain't cops.
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
So... we understand each other Judge?
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
You want me to put a man on it?
Now hold on Rodgers...
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
What's up with you?
Sorry man...
You alright?
Motherfuckers...
My Mom's at that.
It was Sabu killed Cy.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
When?
Congratulations.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Well?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
You look well, Charlotte.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Goodbye, Charlotte.
You're surrendering.
What unit?
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Very well, let us move on to...
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
And the Governor?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Did your father teach you humility?
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
You learned her lessons better than I.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not held, just slowed down.
Don't touch him.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
That bad?
Father, you can't let them take him...
Father... I killed those men...
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
Ellie? What's wrong?
What's up, sugar?
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
What?
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Going to tell Ellie?
Yes, but--
What do you mean?
It's funny, all right.
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Leave me alone!
Let her go. It's cool.
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm going to try to do better.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
That boat is my livelihood!
What's in your head, boy?
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
There's ... another exit?
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Do you believe him?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
You're speaking up for him again?
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Difficult ... to say.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Say again?
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Raise the sails.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
You cheated.
Where does it make berth?
I can get you out of here.
I'd die for her.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
What's that?
No.
You've seen it?
You haven't seen it.
Commodore --
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
... plastic.
How apropos.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Did you feel that?
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Of course, sir.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
You're afraid of him.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
Yes?
What's it smell like?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Susan!
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
... just like the mouse.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Susan!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
Do you have something to bring me down?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
You made this out of my hair?
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
Argon's private lab.
What in the...?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
God, what a fight that was.
Things do change.
That's impossible.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
What in the hell?
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
What do you want?
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Where did you get those letters?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
Really?
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
What's the idea, Anne?
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
—a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
Fine. Have a seat.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Yeah!
Look, I quit!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Sure - I think so, Stew.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Okay.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
To Old Madrid.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
What could I be?
Here you are.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
What other girl—?
No.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
I think you'd better go.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Traps shut!
Thanks. May I sit down?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Okay - you remember Joe—
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Stop calling me Mother!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Heavens! The man's insane!
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
But I—
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Did you call, sir?
You try it.
Yes sir.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
And they won't be able to tell?
Wait.
Oh, hi ...
Where'd you get this?
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
But where would we go?
Sure is pretty.
Oh.  I can't.
I'm busy.
Want some bridge mix?
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
Did you do this?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
Dan! Arrest them!
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
How'd you know about the fire?
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Lemme see that.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
What did you do?
Who's that?
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
What did you do to him?
Me too. Sounds swell.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
No. She really liked you.
How come I'm still in black and white?
And you're sure about this?
No. I baked them for you.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Mmmmgh.
How?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
Why would I do that?
Where are you going ...
WAIT A MINUTE!!
BUD.
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Because you're coming home.
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
There's worse places.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Dream come true, hunh?
Hey.
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
What's the listing?
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Why?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
It's not cool?
Hey. What are you doing?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Where are you?
Really?
It doesn't matter.
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
...yes...
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Not very late.
Uh-huh.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
You lied to me?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
They're not open yet?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Hi.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
I saw a picture of you.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
Do you want to pick me up?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
This is funny.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
How long have you known her?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Are you learning how to play it?
Yeah.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
Where you married?
Yeah.
Yes I'm sorry.
It's a plastic, yeah.
Did you have my home phone number?
Ok.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
What do you mean?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your Social Security number.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Can we agree that that is that?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Hey, good morning, Barry.
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Hey.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Yes.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I know.
I know.
Ok.
I don't really remember that.
As soon as you want.
Put him through.
I'll go pay for my car.
Yeah.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
So...did my brother call you?
Has he hurt you?
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Free his mouth.
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
They can't be serious.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
He can't do that to me.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
Who's to say I did not?
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
His wife's?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Well?
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
It was fiction, of course.
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
How is the patient faring?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
A kiss for each page.
They've taken your clothes?
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Good God, Marquise --
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Who are you, sir?
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Louis
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
There's a different between want and
I just want to understand--
He lied to me
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Nope.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Sigmund Freud?
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Yes.
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
Let me out.
Fuck you--
It doesn't have to be
So, who is he? We have to know him.
How?
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
It's good, huh?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Craig is one syllable
Jesus Christ --
Did I ever tell you about my father?
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Hedy Lamarr?
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
You gonna watch?
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
It came.
You're lying to me.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I think you better sit down
Orson, you wanna take five?
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
He's Christ?
You want to do the life of Jesus?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
Where you going at this hour?
J.R., glad you could make it.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
You know?
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Huh?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
Whatcha doin'?
How's that?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
You don't talk very much.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Huh?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
What'd you see?
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
The kids are sleeping.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
How's the weight? Ok?
I said, let's go.
No, you're his wife.
And you're drinking with them right now.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
She never left the apartment --
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
I can't do that.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Jefferies.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
That's abnormal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
She's only perfect.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Isn't he a salesman?
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
What do you need money for?
One hundred and twenty-seven.
It is something really important, Jeff?
Who's Thorwald?
Goodnight, you idiot.
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Yes.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
So do I.
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
Yeah.
No comment.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
I wonder where he's going now?
Something on your mind, Lisa?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
I hate funny exit lines.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
I'll rephrase the question.
Well?
What for?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
What's happening?
Machismo?
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
How'd he get in?
Any other entrance?
What's he going to pull--
What time is it?
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Mother--
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
You're absolutely right!
I don't think so--
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
John Crawford?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Where did you get the gun?
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
I'm here.
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Hey where'd you go?
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
Here.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
You sure?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
'Bye, Mom.
How!
Do I have to spell it out?
He called me chicken.
What a zoo!
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
Goodbye!  See you!
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
I'm getting that way, too.
You can trust me, Judy.
Well--we're newlyweds.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
What?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
She's being called for.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Good evening.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
I was talking to Dad.
A man of some travels.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Gabriel, you promised!
I've been doing good, though.
Gabriel!
I don't think it's negative five.
Saw me --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
NO!
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
No, Nick, no --
No!
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
They've never done a robbery?
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
You... you... YOU --
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
No --
You... you don't know me --
Put him in the truck.
So you could get with my sister.
So you could get down her chimney.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
What's her middle name?
What's her greatest fear?
You knew the place --
What?
We walked the place for a week.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
No way.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I can't go back to Vegas...
What about the Powwow Safe?
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
What the hell was that about --
You gotta get someone upstairs.
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Rudy, don't move --
Tell Ashley... I...
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Switch seats with me.
That's what it looks like!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
You fuckin' wish.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
The Brewers.
Just hold on buddy boy.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
What's this guy's problem?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
I got the diamonds.
What?
No shit?
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So what is it?
Why!
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Of course.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Anybody hurt?
And this is Helen Carter.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
There's a nice boy.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
So that was why she tried to run away.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
I won't have you fighting over me.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
Who's Lednov?
In a fight?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Why?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
I've got eleven horses.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
Go on, hit me.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You know what she asked me?
I can't take her with me.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
That sure smells good.
Even women?
And you're all alone.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
We don't want to go there.
You're not giving up?
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
We got to get movin'.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
He dropped a shoe. You shouldn't be ridin' him.
What are you doin' --
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Maybe I could start you out.
Aren't we stayin'?
And that's tough, isn't it?
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
She was only teasin'.
Goodnight.
Are you okay?
Me, too. 101?
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
My favorite memory was when we --
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Let's get outta here.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Yes...
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
What should we get?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
How about these buns?
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
I'm Cindy.
Hanson, please.
Stop touching his brain!
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
What are we gonna do?
Father!
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Got a problem with that?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
My God! Is she dead?
The image there.
What the hell?!
Professor, we need to talk.
Hello Dwight.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
You never could feel your legs.
Father, are you okay?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
What does it say?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
BLOOD FEAST!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Because it's the rules!
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Detectives, what is this about?
What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
She's gonna kill Scotty!
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
You bring me such peace...
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Hello.
You bitch!
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
And who may I ask is Carl?
You got your wish.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
You know who I am, August?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
No.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
I'll give you a check.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
Why, Mary --
She's a pretty good sort.
What did she want?
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Who the devil is he?
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
Do you think he knows about this?
Could you find him?
She'll have to know some time.
No!
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
And you knew he'd be here.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Jason, my pet ——
Following me to find Jacqueline?
Yes. When I tell you.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
I didn't know.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Have you ever been on television?
Yes.
Graham is an unusual name.
Oh, uh-huh.
You mean like "time flies"?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
So what about kids?
Are you in the middle of something?
Donna?
And they just answer them?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
This is just... so...
Tell me your name.
Did you have sex before you were married?
No.
About who?
About me?
On tape?
That's correct.
Yes.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
If you were in love with me, would you?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
You're not answering me.
I want to touch you.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
What do you mean, like physically?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
That you are under no obligation to me?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What are you talking about?
Lose something?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
Fine.
No, it's nothing like that.
Because I wanted to.
He wouldn't do that.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
I feel like I do.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
I was just trying to --
Thank you.
The extrovert.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
What did he say?
Then what happened?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Do you like the way I look?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
No.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Hello.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Do you want me to stop calling?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Why not?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
I know. Will you please leave now?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Plenty of room for two people.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
Hi, John.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
One moment.
He said immediately.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
You're the one who found the bodies?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Medical clinic?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Well? Supper at my place?
Where is he now? Do you know?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
NIGHT NIGHT
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
How did you come by this scenario?
SPONSOR!!!
We're the experts.
Out of self comes selflessness.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
Could I do that later?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
Vance!  Vance Parker.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
So what's up?
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
How's the trip?
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
My condolences.
Glass or bottle?
You okay, Miles?
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Yeah.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
That's your problem, Miles.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Sure I know Maya.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Get the trunk.
We're on.
So what should I wear?
Pull yourself together, man.
Later.
Hey, there you are.
Where is Stephanie?
Does she know about Saturday?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Is it the money thing?
With Maya.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
I said okay?
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Do you like them?
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
What's it look like to you?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Please, Miles, please.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Want me to drive?
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
You broke some.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Nice. Very nice.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
I'm having the salmon.
Are you all right?
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Is she sleeping or...?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Bathroom over there?
Okay. See you around.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
That was big of him.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
You quit drinking?
French or American?
So what do you think?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Houdini's sick.
It makes me feel better.
There's dust in it.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
The same windows.
I don't want you to die.
Does it hurt?
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
Explain, act crazy?
Explain noises.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
Do you feel comforted?
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Where are you going?
I can feel air.
They're broadcasting...
How many died?
That's good enough for me.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
We might lose the signal.
Morgan?
I can't even imagine.
What about them?
It's not broken.
Okay.  So he was tall?
I don't think so.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Emmett.
I almost didn't.
Goodbye?
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Jefferson City?
You might make a farmer yet.
What happened?
What about the law?
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
Get out of here, Jake.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
What's all this then?
The jury saw it differently.
Why come to me?
What makes you think I could?
Why him?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
He must be pretty good.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
You got a place to stay?
What is it you want from me?
You really are a gambler.
What is it that I can't figure?
What makes you say that?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
How about you?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
The public decides who's on that list.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
You're not renewing my contract.
Why not?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Hair and make-up?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
-- You can't go in there!
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
... Simone.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
What?... What did you say?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
For her?
You can't.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Is she here?
-- We call them "vactors".
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
How?
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
She thinks you're with Simone.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I love you, Lainey.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Do I know you?
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Mr. Sayer...
What if it catches on fire?
Hi.
Let's take it down a notch.
I am the death of real.
Are you calling me?
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
What were they hiding from?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
No.
Why?
You said the "s" word.
That isn't magic.
I didn't know you were funny.
Yes.
Cats?
I told you what I want.
Don't cry.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
What are you thinking, Momma?
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
I don't know how else to look--
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Suzie???
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Well, there goes our record deal.
Are you crazy?
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
He means moon shining.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
Throw me one.
Never heard of it.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
How does it feel, Keith?
Is that right?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
-- Where have you two been?
Carl.
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Grant, where'd you go?
How about Brenda?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
No reception out here.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
What?
Looks like a chipmunk.
Are you nodding?
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Meat.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Flip.
Where are you going?
Welcome home.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
You got my barley pop?
An existentialist.
So tell me about yourself.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Where you from?
Anything?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Hey...
Jesus!!!
See ya, Kate.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Mississippi's the other way!
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Kate...
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
What kind of a guy is he?
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
Order up!
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
What are you doin' now?
Loud and clear.
You know how to drive one of these things?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
I'm all ears, good buddy.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
You're coming up to the scale house.
Have any trouble getting here?
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Shut up, Fred.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
What about the sheriff's task force?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
No.
You're sure?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
So I guess you're not going.
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
...I'm sorry...
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
It's the last place they'd look.
...Does he know?
...Are you insane?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
So how we lookin'?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
That takes some of the sting out.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
What'd you say?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
Bulllllshit...
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
I want to hear your version.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
How long can you go without sleep?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
What will you say?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What do you want?
When did this happen?
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
What are they?
We're taking a flight?
Rheya...
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
You go home.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Where've you been?
What does Snow think you should do?
Do I really feel like... I am...?
Do you want to stay here?
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
What do I have to do to stop it?
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
He won't do it.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Uh...
I'm supposed to call in.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Let's get a drink.
You all right?
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
Claire?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
Yeah.  It was.
Yeah.
What's to like?
Good night, Mike.
I don't know you...
What do you want to do?
You don't want to know.
Where?
When can I see you?
Claire...
It wouldn't work.
"For"...?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
I like your coat.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Mike?
My ass if falling.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Honey.  You got him.
She's got to identify him.
Bought it.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Mike, take it easy...
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
What did you watch?
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
Ellie...
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
You in this with me?
Wasn't your fault.
Yes.
Are you in charge here?
I asked for the man in charge...
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Hold it...!
Let my kid go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Under the table.
Watch your step!
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Shooting.
What, want a glass?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
I was there.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
You get mugged or something?
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Yeah--
Can we make it a hundred?
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
You're making my life difficult.
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Some things you should say anyway.
Good morning, Liz.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
I suppose.
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
You'd feel what?
I... I like you.  A lot.
Waldos.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Of course.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
The record--
What the hell is that?
Absolutely no class.
Peter, you're bleeding.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Peter, what can I do for you?
So they're airing this tonight?
Do you... live around here?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
What's wrong with him?
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
You make my mouth water.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Break it off!
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
You did?
To the Brick Kremlin!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
May I have this dance, Miss?
Betty! Betty!
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
Why the south latrine?
What radio?
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
Lay off, Sefton.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Who did?
You off your rocker?
Go on.
You taking Dunbar?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Ach so!
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
I'll kill you for that!
The what?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Good morning, Sefton.
What guy?
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
That is my wife.
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Target their Bridge.
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Captain=8A
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
What?
Can you locate them?
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
Soran?
Can I?
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Doctor Soran?
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
I don't believe it...
David, I don't understand...
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
What is it?
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Why?
Did your collaborator know?
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Mr. Scott?
The Genesis planet is gone.
My God...
I know you... Do I not?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
We are clear and free to navigate.
David?... David!
Wait! Give me a chance --
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Give me your hand and we both live.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
So!  Speak!
I ordered no interruptions.
How can you tell that?
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
My Lord... what are your orders?
You amaze me, Commander.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
Physician, heal thyself.
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Say thank you.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Shore leave, Admiral.
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
I still don't under --
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
You did this -- in a day?!
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Jim --
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
It's the Genesis Wave!
I don't mean to intrude.
I didn't expect anything.
They won't --
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Genesis, what's that?
Thirty seconds...
Scotty -- what's left?
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Enterprise to Reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel. Respond!  Nothing, sir.
<u>WHY</u>?
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Yes, Spock.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Is the word given?
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
It literally is Genesis...
What's she doing here?
Not enough against their shields.
Affirmative, Admiral.
What IS working around here?
Uh oh.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Spock!
... the good of the few...
Kirk here.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
I did not think so.
Indeterminate life signs.
Admiral on the bridge!
I really must thank you.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
I can't get power, sir!
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Certainly...
I do this because I was there,
Heard there was some excitement.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
Bones, stay here.
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
Damage report!
... It gives me a great sense of history.
I do not know your name.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
Yes, sir.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
You sure you won't change your mind?
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Or believe, I'll bet.
What's that?
... Who are you?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
So. There we are.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Steady, now. We need your help.
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Ready sir.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Scotty, how long is this bay?
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
The whales...?!
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
You have warp capability?
Will it?
Jak'tahla?
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Don't you ever get tired?
Do machines ever play?
No... I want to stay with you...
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
I don't believe it happened that way.
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
That's your expert opinion?
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
I don't think they believe us.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.  That was three hundred and nine years ago.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Worf to Picard...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
He's activated a transport inhibitor.
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them.
Wine, women and song.
You haven't done that in a long time...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Why don't you try sitting up?
... I'm not sleeping well...
Initiate launch sequence.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
It's Cochrane.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
Isn't it better like this...?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
What year is it?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What did you do to the batteries?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Captain --
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Captain, the Enterprise!
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Were the two of you... involved?
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Track their weapons fire.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Report.
Captain?
Return to our own time?
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Report.
I remember it made me sick.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Thanks...
Are we playing multiple choice?
Specifically of...?
Damned clever if you ask me...
Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire while she is invisible...?
This is fun...
Are you carrying a surgeon?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
It takes a lot of effort.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Shields. Battle stations.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
How did you know...?
Aye, sir.
Kronos, sir?
Sorry -
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
WE volunteered?
Spock, I'm really tired...
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
The peace conference.
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
You must have faith.
How did you - ?
If you are logical.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
NO WAY!
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
- could take weeks, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Can you remember our father?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
And this makes you "sad"?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
Data!
A weapon.
Yes, sir.
Ready, Captain.
How long until we reach the fleet?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Yes.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
Why am I looking at me?
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Yes.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
May I have this dance?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Imzadi. This is so good.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
You're not here.

That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
What's he doing?

So, human... you've met your better self!
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
We're being hailed.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Sir?
Strength in numbers?
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
And you're not as we imagined you.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
You don't trust me.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
Hello, Jean Luc.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
It’s too late.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
So they’ve got him up and running.
My God...
Praetor...
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
How many Warbirds will you need?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Benny, there's nothing there.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
What do you do?
Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?
Where's that?
Recognize this?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I don't like it, George...
Hello George.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
Mrs. Haydn...
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Please...
What?
Ah... no...
Minneapolis... good.
No gas.
What?
Shit.
In your pocket, please...
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
I will see it next time.
Eh... yes...
No... The closest...
Well... I'm going to go now.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Jennyhaydn.
What happened?
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
It's bad.
Asshole!!
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Good morning.
Oh, you're pretty...
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
The cook again?
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Well...
Tell the baby about me.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
I told you I'm looking for someone.
I don't know where he is.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Tell him I'm not here.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Can you see under the faceplate?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Yeah, that's right.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Jesus.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
You think Tran killed her?
No.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
So've I.  Too much.
Top ten.
Looks like she was holding out.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Jesus.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
So there never was a death squad.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
So lay it off to somebody else.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Charm.
It's alright.  He means it.
I don't like disappointments, Nero. And do you know what disappoints me very much?
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Where we going?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Hang on.  Hang on, Max.  You see?
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Take it to him.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Was this him?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Anybody talk to the press?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Who knows.
Agent Mackelway.
You heard?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
A grill pattern.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
I have 6 tons.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Jesus.
Yeah.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I think I talked to him.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Its called insubordination.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
I'm hesitant to...
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Dick Low's a killer too.
Miss me, Dave?
Don't you touch him.
Doesn't fit.
Don't even go there. What's up?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
He's called a couple times.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
And nobody else can do that?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Suspect Zero?
I don't carry it with me.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
[Fantasy time, girls, give it up, give it up.]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Yes, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Thomas Mackelway.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Koessler?
"MyDick?"
I don't think you understand.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Don't do it, Mike.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
I'm sorry?
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
You too?
What else?
Anything?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
Let me just check on my boy.
Always...
You have to lay it on the table.
Who's your booking agent?
It's a rebound.
Sorry, it's just that...
You're a comedian?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Hello?
Yeah, hold on.
Good.  I think about things.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
So what's the difference?
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Unless she comes back first.
There's the rub.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
Darwinism at its best.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Oh, like that song...
You haven't been drinking, have you?
You want to talk about it?
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
You little bitch!
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
It's kinda money, actually.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
You live in such a fantasy world...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hello?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Tonight, baby.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Vegas, baby!
That's where we make our scene.
Always.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
I know. I know.
...Baby...
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Oh... a Dorothy.
What was the part?
No!
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
How you guys doing?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Is she looking now?
It's on.
...we're not...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Sue...
It's on.
But your daughter is still alive.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
What was that?
The food is on the table.
Eat it, it's on the table.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
What is this nonsense?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
And this?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Don Tommassino.
Corleone.
Things went badly in Palermo?
What is it?
Mike!  The party starting!
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Is the hospital covered?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
What was that?
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
Mike, why am I out?
You really want to know?
Then the legs at the knees...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
I LOVE YOU.
Can you say it?
I can't...
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Go on Mike.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
We're going to New Jersey?
And all his works?
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You think I scam?
Yeah.
Is he alive?
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
We?
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
You'd say if you mind?
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Who's this?
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I have to go to Venice.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
I know. I write like a child.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
Ha.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Who is it?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
What about Christmas?
Freddie, do you have something to say?
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
That ring's so great. The green one.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
How long's he staying for?
What?
I was looking forward to seeing him.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
How would you know that?
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
Is this you?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
What rumour?
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
How was it?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
I don't remember the exact date.
You got a .44 Magnum?
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
That's really something.
What hours do you work?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
What are you doing?
Damn.
Hello, Travis.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Oh, Tom, please.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
That's fine.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
For a fee.
Huh?
That ain't much of a name.
What's your real name?
Listen...
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Don't you want to go?
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Why?
You a narc?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
What should I do? Call the cops?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
No, I want long shifts.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm no cop.
I'm here to see Iris.
What's the action around?
Yeah.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
Stick with Carla.
Spit it out.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I don't understand....
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
I'll go.
What, vou?
Partners?
God's speed.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
I believe you.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Did you bring along something to read?
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
I see you got the telegram.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
City hall?
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Do you have the...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
Nine hundred...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
They're not bad.
My what?
Now, did you remember that, or...
Sir, that is true.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
No wallet, huh?
They couldn't wait to see you.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
But I...
Beautiful, wasn't it?
I'm here.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
You kids off to the dance?
Jesus.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
When'd you quit smoking?
Why not?
That was beautiful.
Sit.  Play with me.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Miss Hayworth?
Cathy?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
San Francisco.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
They haven't harmed anyone.
Yes, but where?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Of course.
Daniels.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Yes.
Are you sure?
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
Gulls!
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
How long have you known her?
In a bird shop.
She was selling birds.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Maybe we ought to leave.
Mother, get a rope!
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
They're gone. The same pattern.
They won't be.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Where's Mitch?
Do you think Cathy's all right?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I couldn't ask you to.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
He's not home.
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
No, of course not.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Some of them are.
But how... how do you know my name?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
Why... 
You like me, huh?
Certainly, but...
With... with Annie, of course.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
I do different things on different days.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
What do you mean?
I think it's safe to get out now.
How long have they been gathering there?
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Have we still got power?
Santa Rosa?
What time is it?
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
That... that... who was that?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
We need them.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I haven't finished my drink.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I'm Donald Fettes.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
But Richardson?
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
I don't think I can go on, sir.
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
She's unconscious.
See that, Fettes?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
I will not have you use that name to me.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
You're getting old, Gray, and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of Edinburgh --
A pleasure to torment me?
What did you hear?
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
You and I should work together.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
But where did they get those people?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
We won't.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
Fuck. Me.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No. You don't.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
An accident, Nathan.
But you, you've had them.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Are you ok?
I think I dropped an earring.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Maybe a little demonstration.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Go to the movies.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs -– heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
It was a wonderful day.
I will be in just a minute.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I wonder if we ought to--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Everyone seems so-- 
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Oh -- hello--
What happened?
Just twelve.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
It must be twelve-thirty.
Hello.
But how -- how long--?
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
You sure about that?
No -- no, thanks.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Why not?
Well... we blew Plan A.
All together?
Should I run him through?
They're looking at us.
Whattaya mean?
Don't!  Stop!
Where's Star, David?!
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
David.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Good!
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
He looks dead.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Sam.  Is everything all right?
What did you say?
Not funny, Sam!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Ohmygod...
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
Max!  What's wrong?
I'm really sorry, Max.
Are you following me?
I'm Michael.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You've got to put this on.
Huh?
You're beautiful.
Where are we going?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Michael?
What??
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Where these tracks headed?
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Childs!!
Let's open it.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
You catch anything he was saying?
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
MacReady!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Spaceship of some kind.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
My God, what in hell happened here?
Now hold him.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Right.  Why not?
We're on fire!
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Looks good.
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Somebody definitely messed with it.
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
What kind of test?
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
This storm do that?
What about Childs?
Get your gear on.
You hear that?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
Yes.  Just about here.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
We need your help.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
It's what they want you to see.
Machines?
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
What's your name?
No, we created the Morlocks.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
You took her because she helped me.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
May I help you?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
I know it's not a diamond but --
Let's walk through the park...
We took a walk three days ago.
Alex... people are staring.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
I've been working.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
I know that --
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
You wouldn't believe me.
That's absurd --
You won't say that in a week.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
Good night, David.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
That machine --
Why?
This is magnificent...
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Kalen...
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Might I ask why?
He said he traveled for two months.
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
You know that's not true.
You won't even try?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
Should we be...
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
He's recovering on the third floor.
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
What for?
I looked it up.
How'd he die?
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Do you really believe me?
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
Where are we going?
I think so.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
You don't understand.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
The future doesn't look different?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
You know how to get there?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
This is a great song.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
How?
Hon?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Hey.
That's certainly possible.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Oh shit.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
So how come you don't have any kids?
That sounds nice.
What?
How?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Where'd y'all go?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
You're in Oklahoma?!
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
I'm cash poor.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Call him?
So what are you gonna tell him?
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
You're disturbed.
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
It won't work.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
Louise?  Where are we?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
This is so beautiful.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
What?!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
Sorry!
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
I said all that?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
How far are we from Mexico?
Shit!
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
What in the hell is it?!
God!  It looks like the Army!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Mary again.
You're kidding? What did they say?
His mother?
Mary's a babe!
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Shoot.
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Don't you want to know my name?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Fine. Fine.
A surprise?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
How about -- ?
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Yeah.
So...
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Turn it up, Magda.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Jai alai?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
How many is that?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh. Well I am.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
I don't watch the new ones.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Pat's an architect, too.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I think you'd better sit down.
Oh, are you on the team?
Hi, Ted.
Are you all right?
Ted, are you okay?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Twenty-two.
So you're a writer?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Get out.
Yeah? What do you want?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
No, no, please!
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Franks and beans!
See you, Warren.
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
The other thing is...
Zorin will eat him alive!
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Slow down. Smell that?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
The sun came up today.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Max.
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
What's happened?
If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
I was eating that.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
I don't like what's happening.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
A murder. On the reservation.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?!
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
This is a restricted area.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Couldn't sleep.
Who is he?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I'll sleep around a little.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What did he say?
What was he saying?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
That's not solid.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Still after Jimmy?
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Where was this?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
1868...
This Clear Moon's house?
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Thank you.
What?
X22. Read.
What are you doing on the reservation?
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
No way. No fuckin' way.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Yeah, most likely.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
I beg your pardon.
Yes, ma'am.
Two.
The what?
It never came up.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Harmless!
How about what?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Anything.
Come on.
I want it understood.
Well no...inverse order.
Just good luck.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
You don't believe that.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
Now?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Is it the plane?
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Well, I don't know. That depends.
You think you can stay up with us.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What was that?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Come on, we're next.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Who is the best.
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
Who's the hell is that?
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Was going.  Now you are.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir..
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
I can take care of myself.
Goose is dead.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
You may not think so, but you are.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
So, where to?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
He had help.  From our side, sir.
But I thought...
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Bob?
I'm with an very important client.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
I'm listening.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
You open it.
Suppose I do...then what?
On his way.
Yeah.
They found us!  Everybody out!
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Why not?
Harry, what the hell is this?
Are you saying she liked it?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
I've got a weak signal over there.
Who?
What are you doing?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
Let me finish!
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
I suppose you're not here either.
I love you.
As real as any memory in your head.
No options.
I give up.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I thought you didn't like me.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Where are you going?!
Wait!
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Knock it off, Burt!
What the hell you doing back already?
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
You're full of shit.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
I'm gonna kick his ass!
But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Watch your ass, shithead.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
How's she doing?
Burt!  Heather!
Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
The con...!  Oh my God.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Think it's still following us?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
Don't hurt him.
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Where?
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
That DD-5.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- What?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
-- What?
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I embellished.
I embroidered.
Got any booze in the house?
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
My mother find you?
Figures.
I killed the motherfucker.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
What went down?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
I see: He'd walk out next month.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
You getting this?
It's okay. It was always like that.
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
Tell me some other things about her.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Babe, I'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. Put this cash in your safety deposit box...  It's ten thousand dollars.
The stuff we got last night.
I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
What is it, Gordon?
Phillip?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Where is the ring?
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
A blue rose.
I see. He does talk loud.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
What is it?
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Maybe I better start our homework.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
You're not mad at me?
How did the car get back here?
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Nice night.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
Right on time, baby.
We're on our way, Baby.
Laura, do you love me?
We were supposed to be together.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Oh, Laura.
You always hurt the ones you love.
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
You'd think so.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Where's Dad?
Good night, Mom.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Leland...
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
Come back as soon as you can.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
What did he find?
What are you doing here?
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
...he wants to testify...?
You know what that would mean?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
You would not...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
They lied.
That's not my handwriting.
How old are you?
Ed Concannon.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
What is this going to cost?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
It's all right, Mickey.
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
I didn't do too well for you.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
And you wrote that...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Yes.
I'm sorry...?
The most respected...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
Thank you.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I need an extension for my case.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Nothing further, your Honor...
What Hotel are you staying at?
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Is it over?
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Dr. Gruber.
I have to talk to you.
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
That's right.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
What are you doing in New York...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You look kinda lost yourself.
Did it do you any good?
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
Is that... machine...?
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
Nothing there now.
That needle ain't pointing north!
What is that gizmo?!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
We will, sir!
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Just be careful, okay?
He's had some sort of...episode.
Like Freddy.
Yes.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
no.
You going away?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Home.
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
What...happened?
Really?
You got it.  What's happening?
I know how Chase really died.
Heather Langenkamp?
I want to see the body.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Heather, what is it?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
That was Nancy, not me!
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
No, not really.  I...
Yes?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Did we lose anybody?
He would have loved this.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
You may not like what you hear.
She isn't that old.
Yeah.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
You only hurt yourself you know?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Sorry to here it.
But that's not the point...
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
Good.
I feel like I got you into this.
Ya know... "It".
It was so real...
It works?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Yes, sir.
Well, spit it out.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
Spying?!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Immortality.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
What's your problem?
I don't.
What?
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
About yourself?
Suicidal...
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
What's it going to be?
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
No.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Y'all take American Express?
Need a hand?
No.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
What's she doin' here?
Nice of you to drop by.
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
What'd you say?
Gas?
You hitched yet?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
Oh, many things...
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
What?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
You won't of missed much.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Why we sittin' here, mama?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
You okay, honey?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
What's that honey?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
That don't seem fair.
Sailor?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Actin' funny how?
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What's that, honey?
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
I do.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
You think he saw us?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
What's that, peanut?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
You're scarin' me, baby.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Now what?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
He's the kind liked it.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
What do you want me to do about it?
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Just tell me what you want.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
I know... I remember.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Thank you.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Mm.
I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
I just mean...
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Trip??
You stay there.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Crabtree.
Is he awake?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Better luck next time.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Who the hell is that?
Boy or girl?
...reconcile with Emily.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Well...
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Washed up?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
The one that left you?
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going with them.
Get out of here.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Yes, Hannah?
Thanks for that. He all right?
Me? Sure. Why?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
He cribbed that from Borges.
New?
Emily left me this morning.
And? Are you going to tell him?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
What's he doing out there?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
And what do you think you might have said?
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
The more the merrier.
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
And?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Are you riding with me, James?
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
Five years.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I'm working on it.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
I've got some good news.
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
You don't know?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I'd keep away from him.
Have you seen Walter?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Walter?
You should go home.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
That's right.
I don't understand.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
You have no feelings for your niece?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Why do you think you're here?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Go home, Walter.
When did it all start?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Who do you see?
And what are you doing?
Don't ever do that again.
What else?
You felt pleasure.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
How do you feel about that?
What?
Very weird.
Is that a school?
Doesn't it get noisy?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Molested little girls?
You're not joking.
It's not what you think.
I never hurt them. Never.
You know, this is crazy.
Being here, with me.
Most people say the odds are against me.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
I got poked around... here and there.
I love my brothers.
You're scared.
What's this?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
How you guys doing?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
You never did like being called that, did you?
I think you were worried about me.
What are you still wearing that for?
What happened?
Fine.  Be that way.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
No.
I think it likes you.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
Son of a bitch!
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Alright, put this on.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
No, Bud, no... not you.
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Is that it?  Is this right?
SHIT!
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
Hey!
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
Would we see the flash?
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Which one shall I wear?
Claudia, aren't you coming?
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Somebody must live here!
Nothing... nothing at all!
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
Yes, you should go.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Oh, Sandro...
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
But why am I so infatuated with you?
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Good night, my love.
I don't love you.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
Have you ever been in love?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
It's divine!
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
I'll stay here also.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
And what are we going to do now?
Why don't you try?
What other boat?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Anything new develop?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Are you the owner of this place?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
No.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
But she watches... she listens.
I'm not hungry.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Should you see a doctor?
First thing that comes to your mind?
Uh huh.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Often?
Where do you meet?
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to be?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
How did she know that?
Who?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
And you're unhappy.
What did you do?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
You can tell me.
She's dead isn't she?
How does she know that?
You're a mistake.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why were you afraid?
Will she be angry?
A crucifix.
Who?
Is someone in the room with you?
She said Michael.
Yes.
Are you frightened?
For what he made me go through.
You saw it all didn't you?
What did you do?
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Larry...
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
It's your favourite...
Marie's dead Mama.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
No.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Do you still go to church?
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Is that normal?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Who was the father?
What man had access to her?
Could there have been anyone else?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
It's my affair too.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
Oh, Dear God...
The sheets...
You lied to me
Your niece!
She molested her!
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
We'll see about that.
Because I am a moral person.
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Do you think they ever existed?
I'd like to begin.
May I be present?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
The father!
Somebody told her.
Was it you?
Did you know she was pregnant?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
And the baby.
You tied the cord around its neck.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
She can't remember.
Oh, don't do this!
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Why aren't you at work?
What about all these letters?
Shurrup!
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
I don't snore.
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
Get him out of here!!
Gerron.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
What's up?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Well ... come on.
Sorry.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
They ought to be.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Ah.
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What are they saying?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
That'll keep you busy.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Clean though, isn't he?
Is that yours?
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
Let's go and muck in.
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
I'll brook no denial!
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Hello.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
And my nose...
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
Temper! Temper!
Well!
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
None for me, then?
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Down the ... er ...
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
Eh, what's all this?
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Do you remember the pyramid?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Any rotation?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
This is Chaz.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Are you okay in there?
How do you feel, Dell?
What's wrong?
I have recorded the transmission.
Why, what's wrong?
You like this shit?
Where's it coming from?
Okay.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Dead!
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
It's clear.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Now we're in for it.
Yes.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
It will be.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
Now what's wrong?
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
Receiving.
That way.
It's close, real close.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
No, it's coming.
Oh God, oh God no.
It's stopped?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
No, thank God... just missed him.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
They're on the next level up.
They're getting pretty close now.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Where are we?
What the hell happened?
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
Would somebody fill me in?
Take us up.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Which presumably means...
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
What is it?
Yeah, it's fine.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Oh, man...
Deal.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
What happened?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Already working on it.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
There's still time to back-out.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
Four.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
What is that?
I've found Ackland!
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
You have to...
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
You're more than modest.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
It needn't be.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
You take charge.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Addison...
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
You sat and talked until it was light...
I can't believe my ears...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
That's not true!
Then say so.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Let's go sit by the piano.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
She was magnificent.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
When? When are you going to do it?
I told her. I sounded off.
Bill...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Knit me a muffler.
Happy birthday, darling...
Yeah... I will.
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Happy little housewife...
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
For instance what?
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
The kid. Junior.
I mix what I like.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Never try to outguess Margo.
A cowboy.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
You hear all kinds of things.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
The same size?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Why not?
She works hard.
She's loyal and efficient-
Late for what?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
You probably won't believe me.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
I'm going to take you to Margo...
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
Not just that way. As a friend...
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Oh, but there is-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
Addison wants me to play it.
She knows enough not to be here.
Congratulations, Eve.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Hi.  Hello, darling-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Margo, really...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
Why should he - and why should you?
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
Margo, again...
That's on time for Margo.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
Who is it? What's it all about?
How about calling it a night?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
I never said it was!
Hello..
"Liebestraum."
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
I said I'm a dying man!
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
Carl?
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
Hey?
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
--what do you think?--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
And?--And?--
Were you eyebrow reading?
Anything you've got.
'68.
Did he just say what I think he said?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
He'll give us a sworn statement.
Woodward?
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
Donald Segretti?
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
But you know who did.
Can't help you.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
--and we got a guy in Justice--
What's a real denial?
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
FBI too?
Hey, easy...
We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
One minute but then--
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
But they both worked at the White House?
Right.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--I saw him. He verifies.
I got Clawsen on hold--
--what do you think?--
They are not my clients.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Talk about Segretti--
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Where in government?
Are you sure?
But it's possible.
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
...go on, go on...
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
What'd you get on W.House?
--who you got?--
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
More denunciations?
--no--
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
--which Young?
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
Go on.
--look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Great evening, isn't it?
What did you just say?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
All right, I got some scotch.
This.  Right now.
Of course, Finch.  What?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Just go!
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Um...Chris --
Do I have to?
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
Stifler told me.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
So you're going to Michigan?
Onions?
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
He likes it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Fuck me!  Yes!
Ow, what the hell?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Hey, where's Finch?
You can send me the address too.
Hey, minuteman.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
Yes.
Dad!!
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
She's a mermaid, dude.
This was remade?  Into what?
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
You did it.
No...you...go...ahead.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Uh...
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Jim...
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Tonight?
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
That's my trick!
Like how?
I think you're so right, Kevin.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
You sure you're comfortable?
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
That was a great night.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Hey.  I got another question for you.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Kevin, it was just a --
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Our last game is this Saturday.
Here, babe.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Either way works for us...
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
Serafine...
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
They're coming!
Holy mother of God...
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
Okay. Be careful.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Claude...?
We know you were with her.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Uncle Terrence?
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Jesus...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Why would he pick this one?
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
What've you got?
Now!
Merde.
Well?
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Why were you so late tonight
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Are you running away?
Where is your home, Anya?
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Is everyone all right?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Forged papers! Now, what?!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Nervous?
Who are you, child?
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
Trust me, it's her!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
I'll show you!
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
What do you mean, next?
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Two minutes, Alvy.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
The alarm clock.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Alvy, I...
I-you know, I don't wanna.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Uh, you're driving a-
For yuh.
All right.
Your grammy!
Neat?
Duane?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
it's my first time.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
And we'll digest our food better.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
No.
Here, you want some?
Yeah?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
That's the key question.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
M'hm.
Yeah.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
and I keep, you know, it's-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Oooh.
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Yeah?
Happy birthday.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
yes, we had, uh...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Christ!
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
What'd I do?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Oh.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Forget it, Max.
How about a ginger ale?
The one with the V.P.L.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
M'hm.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Oh. What about?
Oh, gosh.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
The movie.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
You don't have any clothes on.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Thanks for coming.
He's gonna miss his flight.
Take good care of it.
I'm the hired help.
Directing suits you.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
So?
And?
But she's alright.
You need to call your dad.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Whatever you say.
Kiss the back of my knees.
No.  Did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
Don't get it.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Yes.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
It's an unfair advantage.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
It's not like this all the time.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Anyone else?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I know.
What's a sign for that?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes, she is.
Ours.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
A little out of my element.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Are you okay?
Lemon or raspberry?
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
What?
I didn't say a word.
Jesus Christ.
Ryan.
We could hardly say no.
I'm so sorry.
Come on in.
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Panes is here!
She's even better looking in the flesh.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
You're a shit.
Um.  Happy for you.
Monica and Ryan.
Like Joe.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Break's over.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
What <u>was</u> that thing?
I order you to find out where we are!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Water...water...
And only you can become a Queen?
Come on, Z.
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Barbatus!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
ARREST HIM!
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Yeah, I know.
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
What did I tell you?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
What did you do to your hair?
Oh, I never catch colds.
That makes me feel just terrible.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
No.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
His apartment?
Something wrong with your legs?
Your stomach?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
What for?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I would.
What are you doing with that?
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I know so. He's a taker.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Shall I light the candles?
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
How's everything at the apartment?
I never thought he'd do it.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
The Vice Squad?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Where is your apartment?
I'm not through with you yet.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
I see.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Hi, Baxter.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Any of that coffee left?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Say, this is Snugsville.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
And what happened to you?
Please -- just let me sleep.
What for?
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Well -- thank you.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I missed you, Fran.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
That's enough, Fran.
Coming?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
What !
No -- absolutely not --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
We've been attacked.
North ?
Yeah.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Holy shit.
Why they call you that?
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
That's a light down there --
Charlie?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Well, get in there.
They're not Cong.
I --
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Listen.
They nail him for it bad ?
I only met Kurtz once.
What does that mean ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
How did they know?
Yeah.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Where've you been riding, Lance?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
What'd you do for supplies?
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
He'll kill us.
No -- no, Captain.
This one , Lance?
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
You hear it again?
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
So that's it.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
What show ?
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
30   CONTINUED:
117  CONTINUED:  
95   CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!
26   CONTINUED:
Had?
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Was there any trouble?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
That's not what I meant.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Where's Corbett?
Ben Corbett?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Does he have people?
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
If Corbett's men find out --
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
What's wrong?
Alleged killer.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Thought that door was open last night...
...Ben never sent a signal.
It's Sam Wilder!
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
I'm sorry.
Do you love me?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Me. My home number is on this card.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
What about your mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Getting loud, getting loud.
Okay.
I was going to do that for you.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Thanks, Melvin.
Hey -- you let him...
You wanna dance?
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
How you doing?
That seems like a good choice.
Cute.
I should've danced with you.
What do you want, Melvin?
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
Help!
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Hey -- you called me... I...
Good evening.
Is he dead yet?
Sure thing.
Which color was that?
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Would you leave now, please?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
You going to come talk to me or not?
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
What's wrong?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Is there a problem?
Where you from?
Why?  What happened?
No shit.
You can't --
Bain.  Michael Bain.
So what happens now?
Okay.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'm on the scent.
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.
You think this is a fucking joke?
What?
Um, five.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
You're one of them, aren't you?
Why?
No.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
I was just different.
No, they didn't.
Because you are a women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Good.
Do you think he's here?
You should knock.
How was the beach?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Then, we wait.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
I don't believe that.
What did he say?
Was that it?
You didn't take it.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Did you think they were newlyweds?
Nobody ever sees me.
Can I ask you something?
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
Did you --
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
That doesn't sound normal.
Four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
Electra --
I thought it was interesting --
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Why are you working today?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Is that all you want?
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Some.
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Of course, senor.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Anything in it?
Like Custer huh?
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
It must be on the other side of this.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
We're going to need it all.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
Do you think anyone will really come here?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
My God! What happened?
And a tram hit you?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Huh?
I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming, he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the Bugler.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Yeah, pretty well.
There shooting at something.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
I've been around.
We should be done by the weekend.
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
She's tired.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
And take Jiri with you?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Will they free me?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
We_re not all running away
I'd better get you to a hospital.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Run into Josh?
Where did you steal the car?
This is your doing?
You will wish you hadn't.
Enjoying our hospitality?
I'm not sure it's possible.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Would you like your things now?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Josh!
I don't want to go.
Come on Holly!
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are quite sure it's secure?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
What if they expel you?
Why not?
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Now it's okay?
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
I'm thinking.
Don't call him a dipshit.
She's like some Puritan.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
What's with the friggin numbers?
I'll get something for us to drink --
Because I try to be nice to people?
Saturn. Beautiful.
You have to believe to have faith.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
I haven't been nice to you.
It's a start.
So you're talking to me?
Like fire.
Yes. But not as a date date.
It's only 7:30.
Excuse me?
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
How do you know this place?
What'd you tell your father?
One of your secrets.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
I've talked to your father.
By accident --
Did you give him a gift?
I'm asking how much.
Materially or spiritually?
Landon. You go on home.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You've been well?
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Morning Dick.
Learn anything?
Here's your jacket!
You remember me...?
What time does school start around here?
Hi, Marty!
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Fine..
No, Chinese food is fine.
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
Maybe if I used my left....
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Catch you later! 
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
Where did you get this?
My guess is that she turned him down.
There's no way of knowing.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
Obviously!  
What theater was I at?
What happened to Dick Wilson?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
What do you feed him?
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Well, Kit...
Good luck to you.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir.  That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
You still in school?
Can I be honest?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Nothing.
Hi.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
You're a redhead.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
What a nice place.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
My stomach's growling.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
You tired?
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Have you got a better idea?
What's that?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Who are you?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Planet 10?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
Go away.  Let me rot?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Was she pretty?
The girl I remind you of.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Pick those up, Reno.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Let him go.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Barton!
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
Chet!
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
What's that?
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
I'm a writer. Ted O –
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Go ahead, son.
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
...Got a sweetheart?
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
It's okay, it's okay.
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
How did you know about that?
Yeah, but –
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
It's okay... It's okay...
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Big fuckin' deal.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Where were you tonight?
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
How are you, Nick?
What was she like?
I need a cigarette.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
I'm De...
How long were you dating him?
Were you with him last night?
Did you leave the club with him?
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
But you didn't hurt --
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
I didn't.
I like you.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
No.
You won't believe me.
About three months before I met you.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
How'd you get in here?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Why?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever tie him up?
How did he die?
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
What kind of drugs?
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Was she ever a suspect?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
How'd it go, son?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Why not?
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
Keep your three o'clock.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
You knew her, didn't you?
Why do you think he's dead?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
When's your show?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
That was my favorite part!
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
No.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
When?
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Who am I?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
We got beat.
Good.
Guess I just got sick of him.
You're back.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
What's wrong with me?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
I'll take the whole tin.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Some of them.
See you later.
Come on.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
What? What do you want?
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?
'Phillips head,' right?
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I guess this mean we won.
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
Admiring your handiwork?
You're not the Mayor.
We've met.
Didn't I say that?
Well that's a ... long story ...
Pouring myself into my work.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
What happened?
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Son!
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
You have?
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
It's good to see you.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
How did you...?
No sign of the snowman.
Winded, old timer?
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
No!?
I wouldn't bet on that.
That's gotta hurt.
What happened to his wife?
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
...Afraid.
Letters in the alphabet.
What now sir?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
May I help you, Master Grayson?
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Mr...?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
So glad you could come.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
What do you know about obsession?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Edward...
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
A-14.
B-12.
Yes?
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
No.
What did you see?
I don't sing very well.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
I understand.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
... Why the mask?
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Yeeees?
Do we know anything about him?
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Scottish.
Go ahead.
Liar.
Ali?  What's wrong?
Let's get a coffee.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Goodnight Annie.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Everything okay, David?
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
You're not going to ....
Maybe two cars.
Welsh.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
... in the distant future.
Interesting suit.
off the peg?
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
So, like, where is she?
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
That's not that much.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Turd-burglar...
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Chief, look!
Do her? Huh huh.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
You'd better sit down, hon.
Handbook for the recently diseased.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Cabin fever, hon?
Maybe this is heaven.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
That little girl saw us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
I guess we open it.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Help vouchers?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
All right.  Who are you?
Just get some people out of our house.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
We're very unhappy.
No.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Beetle!
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
Your qu...?  But you're...
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Okay?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
What do you think?
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
I would like to walk today.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
I hope you're comfortable.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
What is that?
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I see.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Bravo!
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
What about money?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Correct.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
You heard?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
... Ben, really...
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
And look who you brought with!
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Would you take me on a tour?
It's that gardener!
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
... So what does all that add up to?
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
... Well?
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
You take care too, Bobby.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
I never played a jewel thief.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Enjoy.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Which one is Elijah again?
Why, Craig. why?
Hi.
I have to go back now.
How was it?
Why?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
It's Elijah.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I know. I'm sorry...
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Moving story.
Is that true?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Hi.
This is important!
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
I've fallen in love.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
You can be John Malkovich.
Two hundred dollars, please.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Ah.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Never heard of it.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Yeah what?!
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Well?
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
YOU HURT ME.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
That girl...You know, Beloved...
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
They good whitefolks?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Won't you be late for work?
But mama..
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
What run him off? Tell me that!
You?
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Hiya Allan.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Excuse me?
Can we just rent it from you?
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
Where you going, Dude?
What tied the room together, Dude?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
What's a pederast, Walter?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Burkhalter.
It's already posted.
Are you gonna split hairs?
Am I wrong?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Please!  Please!
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
No.  Here.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Well--sure, I could do that--
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
What happened to your house?
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Huh.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
The fucking point is--
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
...Huh?
That's it.  I'm out of here.
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
No.
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Huh?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
What's mine is mine.
It's a heart attack.
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Employed?
Is this a--what day is this?
Huh?
'Scuse me?
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Smokey Huh?
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Bullshit. Walter!
Why?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
how long since he was bitten?
Recognize him?
Thank you.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
You don't want to go there.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
And so will we.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
You want me to hunt them for you.
So you're going to do this?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
His name is Jared Nomak.
From his father, of course.
Yes?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Whistler!
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
What took you so long?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Who dies first?
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
You shouldn't be here.
How did you know?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
What are you doing?!
Graffiti --
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
Like what?
You're hurt --
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Just get out of here.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Is he sick?
You care about him, don't you?
Are you all right?
How long have we been driving?
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
You don't have to be.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
You're a monster.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
What happened to the power?
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
What, are you alright?
Not that I can see.
No.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
No!
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Oak?
Yeah, so?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Cheery little place.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Your body, your call.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
What?
Baby names?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
What'd you dream?
Absolutely.
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
Beer and weed is what I've got.
How'd you know they were--
I don't know yet.
Does it hurt?
Okay, a blur.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
So lemme see it.
The witch?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
What movies?
No fucking.
What're you, crazy??
Me, too.
Mi casa y su casa!
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Cotter?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
Be it still alive, James?
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--Cotter--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
<u>What</u>?
How're the cameras doing?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
What?
Why?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Oooh. Oooh.
What?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Elly Kedward?
Jesus.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
--I know!
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Why?
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
--yes--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
On the phone. Was it for you?
Well... the couch would be all right...
I could've sworn I heard something.
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Well I'll be damned.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
...You all right?
...Ray?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
Well... what happened?
...So?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
So how long have you know Meurice?
He needs a room, Dusty.
I told you. I like you.
What "what"?
What did you take these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
Yeah. Is it...
...it's too damn risky.
...Why?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Jeffrey?
Anything you can tell me?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Is Sandy part of this?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Where are we going, Frank?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
THEN WHAT?
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Come in.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
I want you to hurt me.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Shh. I'll tell you.
No thanks.
I don't want to go.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yeah, how did you know?
How is Central these days?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I've gotta go in.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
O.K.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
What's with Mike?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Yeah.
You worry about me really?
What was that all about?
It's okay.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
... Sandy?.
Are you feeling okay?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
What?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Well.
He comes over to study.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
What are watchin' this junk for?
On the plane.
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Nothing like this back home.
Tuna, this is crap.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
The coca is my responsibility!
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
I don't think so.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
No?
What do you got there, Diego?
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
But you must.  It's the only way.
George, good to see you, my brother.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Barbara.
G-d, son.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
Freedom.
Sure.
Keep them coming.
Money.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Hi.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
I meant every word of it.
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Pablo said no?
Hey, George.  You okay?
Yeah.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
What do you want from me?
California, huh?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I swear.  On my life.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I fucked up.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
But I have a visitor.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Yeah?
So?
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Are we good?
No shit, Kevin?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Of course. As soon as possible.
Go away!
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
Good evening ... Can we pass?
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
An inquiry into what?
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
I think I'm going to make your day.
What induced it?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Why would she want that?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
Tell the court about that, please.
How did he look?
She was here?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
Why did she say she was leaving?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
What happened after that?
Yes.
Did you suggest any?
What did she say?
-- And what did you suggest?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Yes.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
What did you prescribe for her?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
High school?
No.
Did he make your life miserable?
What happened?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
How do you know that?
Who told you that?
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
--and that he changed his will?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Yes.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
This is your house.
Why not?
What do you think?
Hi, Frank.
Yeah.
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
Why would she lie?
Sugar or honey?
What's that for?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Alright, I'll talk to her
I can back it up.
If you want me to.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
Humped
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
I know.
I don't know.
Not even if they're a dork?
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Well, I can help.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
I thought everything WAS arranged.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
What's he saying now?
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
Grateful!?
Well, I'd like to read them.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
She's changed.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
This time of year.
Mind if I smoke?
Feeling better?
Help cook?
What?
And did you?
Why did you stop?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
You drink bug repellent?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Francesca?
You really don't need anyone?
But no one in particular.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Yes.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
What were you like when you were younger?
I can't do this, honey.
I... What do you want?
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
I don't know. Please...
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
Betty.
Died there?  How?
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
You soundin' like the old man now.
Where's the others?
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
We can climb out.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
You got a nice crib here.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
I said, no thanks.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
Aren't you going to join us?
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
It's alright, baby.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
We'll have to sneak in.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
What else does she say?
Cinn?
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
You got the cash?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
What the hell do you want?
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Jimmy Bones?
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
Oh, shit ...
She's doing the work herself.
So, you just got out?
Not bad.  What for?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
It's impossible!
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Got to think this through ...
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
He didn't see you, did he?
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
You can't leave.
What are you doing?
I saved you.
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
What?
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
But everybody is all right.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Now that's teamwork.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
How many'd you do?
You can't kill me yet.
Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
Cease, can I ask you something?
Is that the money?
Hello?
I guessed you were straight black.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
'63 Chevy.
Do you know him?
Okay, one drink.
I had to see you.
Five years is a long time.
I'm glad you did.
We're not that different, Corky.
Because it's the truth.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Yes.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
What happened?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
What if he doesn't run?
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Done.  We go now.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
What do you mean?
Paris.  I live in Paris...
I think so.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Who do you think sent me?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
I need a ride out of here.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
What if I say no?
What does that mean?
That's what I'm saying.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
He came to kill us.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.

Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
He run away often?
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
Sir...
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You drink rum?
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
...ixed itself.
... fix themselves.
I think we'd better have a look.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Er ... Thanks ...
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
In fact, killing people -
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Help me!
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Long time no see!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Triplets.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
What?
Layton! Oh shit!
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How much do you know?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
Christ! You do know it all!
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Er ... no.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
And you're mine.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Take her off the list.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Jack?... Jack?
You stupid bastard!
Stamped?
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why?
Where are you taking me?
What's going on here?
It's heavy.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Will you please turn back.
I was right! Step on it!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
What?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
I'm going to open it!
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Hey - that's my desk!
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Whatever happened to you?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
But I could be anybody.
I don't know which numero.
Now look what you've done to him.
What is it?
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Can you fix it?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
Es impossible.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
Does that hurt?
What about Kanita?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
IB Bangin.
Here, you try.
Do you have any music?
Is he going to be alright?
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
I think this place stinks.
Yes?
Not as good as Nino's.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
This is not a good time.
Who is it?
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
I hate vodka.
Where's Burke?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
These are hard times, Tom.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Where you going?
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Well why didn't you say so?
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
He's crazy.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
I don't like being handled.
No.  No.
No.  Don't worry about it.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
You know what I...
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Which would you prefer?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Okay.  Let's do me.
Watch? --
Sounds like you may be on to something.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Yes.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Do it then.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Just a few questions?
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Just when do you start, telling people?
But thanks.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
What did he say?
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
Anchor?
Ernie, they're calling from work.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
One year...almost one year.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I've got another story.
You okay?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
So what did you think?
It's incredible who's here.
What?
No.  Did he really?
What?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
Why?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
I knew what you meant.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
That's enough.  That's enough.
Don't you work here?
It's kind of dark -
I'm almost ready -
Let's see it.
I like you very much, Walter.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Hi Walter...
Maybe so...
What's the matter with you?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Man this is heavy!
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
People seem to like my cat.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
You might talk too much.
What do you have in the box?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Did you see my cat?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Are you done with these?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Hello Mayolia.
I don't think so Mayolia.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Oh, OK.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
T-tell him that?
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
Well, um... litter?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Man has a complex.
It's coffee.
Figures.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
I'm fine.
Which way did she go?
Dying.
What show is this?
What'd you dream about?
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
You broke up with my machine?
You're even weaker than the others.
Hi.
Is that your car?
Well, stay here tonight.
Where are you gonna go?
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Thanks.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
I'm going out the front.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Bugs.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
How do you know all this?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
What, um...  What do we do?
Not a pressing issue.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Oh.  Sorry.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Same one.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Wait!
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
That is so cool.
I don't get it.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
Why?  Why me?
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
You think so?
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy?
Omniplex?
Cool!
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
I really was way way too too.
Except for Prom.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
Ah, you'll be coming back.
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
God, I never thought of that.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
The right nostril.  Good.
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
I'd like you to meet my father.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
You should be at the game.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
See my hips?
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Damn.
Your place or mine?
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
What's that?
Will that work for me?
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Why you shaking me off?
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Fastball.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Party without me.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Settle what?
Why am I a fuck?
I'll take you back to the hotel.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.
Well tell 'em, honey.
Little high.
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
You were wandering around.
A powerful man.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
...been right, but who knows?
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
She's not here, Sam.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
I'll call you right back.
Now this is just a signature card.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Dad!
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
...very difficult to get in.
Hey, Ace.
You think he got the point?
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
You should say so.
All right, fine.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
You lost your control.
All right.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Yeah.
What - what, Caesar's?
...hundred yards further down the road.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Seven o'clock?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Well, sir, I was just...
...position...
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
It's always been our policy -
I'll be right back.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
You're with me now.
Want to go? Let's go back in.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
Huh?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
...under?
Yeah.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
So, what'd ya do with it?
Yeah.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Get off of me! Stop it!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I put her to bed.
With Jennifer.
To the Riviera.
Why do you want to do that?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Hi, Sam.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Fuck you.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
I want you to let me go.
Get - Get up! Get up!
I wouldn't -
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
You are not threatening me anymore!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
When I left here with the money...
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You gotta go back out there.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
All right. Okay, okay.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Leave me alone!
Is that what you did?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Artie! Artie!
Hey, Frankie.
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Are you sure?
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
I can see that. Sure.
He gives a fuck what I do?
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Thanks.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Yes, you did.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Yeah.
Nicky, please...
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Great.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Yeah.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
We'll go later.
Right.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
...they're in Penthouse K.
Hey, how you doin'? 
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
I know. I know.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Frankie!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
You're a little confused?
Since when do you talk like that?
Again!
I know, but that's enough.
Works for me.
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.

He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
Selina, are you okay?
I've been looking for you.
What do you want from me?
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
God-damn..
Car wash, Captain?
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
Spooky.
Hello, Spooky.
I'm a good mother!
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Did you try to kill...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
Don't sneak up on me...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Any place.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
Are you guys all right?
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Lady, don't let him do it!
I told you I should've cuffed him.
You switched license plates?
If you know that just back off.
And stop with the directions.
Got your badge?
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Any minute.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Where'd they take you to?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What do you do for a living?
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
Does she wear glasses?
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
What's going on?
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
It won't be him.
What did you do?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Yes.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
At least one.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Any idea where you're going?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
I'm handling it.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
Five ... six.
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
You're making it too easy.
Where do we meet?
I'm here.  Where are you?
Satisfied?
You should've done all this before.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Negative.
And then?
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
Who am I talking to?
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
I thought so.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
See that, Col?
He gave me a look.
He agreed that he was.
He's still looking, Col.
Maybe he wants something.
Sure, Dave --
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
You American?
That should make her happy.
Everybody wants something.
You all right?
You on the game?
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
What'll it be?
As different as it's possible to be.
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
Drink.
Can't leave me now.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
What you thinking of, hon?
Why?
Even now.
Sorry, darling.
Sure I do.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
I didn't mean to hit you.
Will you meet me again?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
There's Dave. He knew too.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Dil, this is Jude.
It's her, isn't it?
What you doing, Jimmy?
You do something for me, Dil?
You want another haircut, baby?
You want to make me look like him...
Told you to stay in the hotel!
I had to go to work!
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You killed my Jody?
You didn't.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
And you'll never leave me?
Promise?
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
So you did fuck up.
She's nobody. She likes me.
Of course. I forgot.
And what if I say no?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You a handyman, Fergie?
Why would you do that?
So he knows your name?
Back in a minute, Jody
Why?
He's at home.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
Thank God for that.
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
How did you know it was her?
What do you know about my nature?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No, what's the funny thing?
C'mere.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
She your wife?
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now put it back in.
Fergus?
We don't look on it like that.
Depends on what you believe in.
You liked her?
Don't know her.
See if she's all right.
What?
Like the one about the frog?
Faster than cricket?
What?
Don't run off, Jude.
Come and get me, soldier --
I said shut the fuck up --
Oh, come on!
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
Only we call them agents.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
I believe you.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes -- ?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Starting with his own.
What's your first name today?
Oh.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
How long do you intend -- ?
Do I knock or something?
Back where?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Carson Dyle is dead.
Does it hurt?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who told you to do that?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
No sense messing up the streets.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
What are you doing?
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
Why don't you shut up!
Are you going to listen?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Forty-five thousand.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
About how wealthy would you say?
Where did he keep his money?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Of course it is.
I was, too.
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Voilà what?
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Where did everything go?
Come on. You can't stay here.
Hallo, Peter.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Peter -- are you all right?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Who is it from?
I get all your CDs.
One more time.
Hi Jody.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
is there anything you do?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
It's almost ten o'clock.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Hi honey.
A little.
Ok.
You know her?
You were eavesdropping.
What did you hear?
No!
Should we close down any eruption?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Is Jody still awake?
What are you doing?
She was murdered?
No.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
We just found another body.
You fucked me up!
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
No!
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Are you O.K.?
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
Are you coming to the party?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Lisa Sherman?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Yeah.
What?
You can have both if you want.
Hide your laptop here.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
That wasn't me ...
Stacy?

 Oh...
Damn.
Where's Sam?
I need your truck.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
That dog ain't mean.
...up.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...

No cell.
...-er.
Yeah, borrowed!
 
...-damn!
    Elvis is on ice again.
...I'm not the psycho.
...waiting!
Come on, old...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Come on, old Pete.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...wanna give it a try!
Whoo!
I made it!
What the fuck was that?!

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

 Okay.  Okay. 
 Aw, shit  
You're--?  What?!
Oh, no!
Okay.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
Listen, Arlo...
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...

...deal with this asshole.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
They're takin' off.
Hey, hey, hey.


...-natic.
...to him. 
Here...
Shoot me. 
Mason.
Come on.  Come on.
...-ta get outta here!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.


...truck that kept Elvis cool?
You, Arlo.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
No.
Oh!
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.


Well, that just about figures for today.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You got a prob-...

They were all wearing hardware.
Yes, sir.
And I changed the schedule.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...that.
Mm-hm.
"Went away."  I like that.

Do you know what'll...
Good to see you again, Leo.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Vaughn.
Shit.
Dennis!
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
Quite a getup for jacking...
I beg your pardon?
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Not tonight...


No.

I would've in another life.
...it.
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Geneva just pulled the plug.

 ...that tunnel.
That little geek is my...
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...

Mason.
...-m-means, Mason.  

 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
...you answer mine.
...to talk, son.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Get in 
 Talk to me.

It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
An honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
Then these are all new owners?
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
How did she get that idea?
Too bad?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
What does this mean?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
How do you do that?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Hello.
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Off the alley.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
I'll throw that in too.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
Yes.
That's just lovely.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I don't want it anymore.
How do you happen to know her?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Where?
What's the maid's address?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
No.
You and your husband never discussed her?
Would you like something to drink?
My husband's at the office.
I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
For very long?
K... Cross.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
When was the last time?
It was in Chinatown.
What about it?
I saw him.
This morning.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
It's possible.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
She's too upset.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I said the truth!
How do you know?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Yeah, Sophie.
Who?
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
When it comes.
Come again?
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Apple core?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Now what can you see?
Father, I have sinned...
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
You're still beautiful...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
How long's it been shut?
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
And the notice?
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Emily!
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
A rooster?
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I won't let you go.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
First of all - 
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Oh, yes, the bonus.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
The banks are out of luck, eh?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Unnhh!
Jesus!
Hey, now wait a sec...
I think you'd better leave now.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
You're kidding.
Nobody! I swear!
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
You mean, on a date?
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Sang.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Excuse me, do you have...
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
Shit!
You're late.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
You don't want to know.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Five years.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
What's that?
I guess.
It would stand to reason, yes.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
Perfect dozen.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Nudie booth?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Why'd you apologize?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
Don't yell at me, pal.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Oh, my god.
How? When?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
An embolism in a pool.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
No!
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Let me borrow your car.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
Please, get the hell out of here.
I like to expand my horizons.
No way!
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Really?
You're happy to get a fine?
What did she say?
You're kidding.
Around three or something.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
You didn't have to choke me.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
To talk to you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Are you open?
Do I know you?
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Be careful.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Here. Now leave me alone.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
What? What is that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
How many girls have you slept with?
It better be up to and including me.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
He requested this?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
You sucked his dick!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
How many?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Hey! Where are you going?!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
A few?
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
What is it?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
No way!
Is he staying here?
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
To an Asian design major.
You hope what feels good?
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
That's the price, my brother.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I'm not sad.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Surprise me.
Tucker?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Glad you could drop in.
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
Enough.
I can't believe you just said that.
It was great.
Gabe...your arm?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Nice view, huh?
Gabe are you alright?
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
What's he doing?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
Murdering, motherfucker...
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Where's the third one, Travers?
Get off my back, Qualen!
Don't give him anything.
This way.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
You got what we need?
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Been punished, yeah?
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Yes. They want to help.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good evening, my boy.
Thank you, sir.
Fine, fine.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Yes, sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Do you mean Church of England?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Good. What do you want?
Fucking hell...
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Carry on, Chief.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
How many to a cell?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
You like Bach?
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
But not now?
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Annie...it's Max.
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
This your current address?
A deer?
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
No.
You know Dmitri?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Lay it on me.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
I picked up a tail.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
It's nothing.
Hi, Ma.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
You're kidding me.
He's not paying you one cent!
You hassling my driver again?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
Got it?
You listening to me?
What about that?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Are you breathing?
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who's that?
Collateral damage.
Let him go, Vincent.
Let's go.
Show up for <u>what?</u>
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Would you have called her?
Who's Heller?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
As in...? 
Well.  That was brilliant.
Max?
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
I was only going one way.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I better get going.
Just relax.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You okay?
If my universe had a hub...
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
You will?
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Now what?
Is that what they told you?
Back where?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
How'd you get the picture?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Can I ask you something?
Excuse me?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
What?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
David --
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
You...
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
What does it say?
J39 Z186...?
Got a bogey, boss?
How's the spying tonight, guys?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Talk to him.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
I'd say this is slightly different.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
I'm serious about this, Peter --
You sonofabitch.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Champagne please.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I flinched.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
Did you love him?
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
Ellie --
How do you mean?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Hi.
They don't believe me.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Lookit her bounce.
Go git it, Luke.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
Whatcha got?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Oh lookit that brunette.
That's my baby.
Well, whatta we got here?
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Cuter again.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
One, two, three... 
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Now look what you did.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
You're fired.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
We'll get the paramedics...
He was lying.
Who are you?
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
What book?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
In jail.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Would you want to work with us on this?
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
But it's a different m.o.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Answer it.
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
Where were you?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
Have you seen it?
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
Have you seen his penis?
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Isn't that rather too close...?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
What kind of place is this?
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
What?
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
Maybe.
Really?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
How can I help?
It'll be fine.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Are you sure, Dear?
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
I'm only looking out for you.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
Chair, cup and ball.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
For a price.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Just checking.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
I love your apartment.
Hey.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Good luck.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
The store was busy.
I think I should go home.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
I guess we need to talk.
I sure know what that feels like.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
No, you've done a perfect job.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
What?
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
They left about a half hour ago.
And?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
But you were there?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
And for my help I would get what?
I don't know.
For what?
Yeah.   We just go home.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
Why not just steal another one?
Why is everything an argument with you?
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I thought they came with batteries.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
That moron.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Just find them!
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What room number?
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I knew I should have driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
No.   It's mine.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
How do we know what room she's in?
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
Algeria.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
When do we go?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
Why?
What's this?
Okay.    Okay.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
On guard!
Tell me, who is your master?
You're already a thief.
Put them down.
Do you know her?
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
I've missed you.
Please.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Here you must be in proper attire.
They forced me to marry!
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
What do you want?
Never!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
You were enlightened?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, not yet...
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
It's Jade Fox!
They're gone.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
They couldn't do anything for me.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Mister Funboy.
Do you feel okay.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Cute nickname, don't you think?
Top Dollar.
Neither.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
What the hell are you?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
You'll be alone.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
...necklace... pearls...
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
Who got himself what?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
Why not?
You a lesbo?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
Need a lift?
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
No, not at all.
What are you reading?
Need any company?
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
You know what? I don't take it back.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
The football stud?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
I'm in the bath, mom.
What was that?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
That's great.
See that wasn't so bad.
Well do you like him?
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
What are you doing?
I was just kidding.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Don't you want to change that?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Yes!
Where is she?!
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
What are the terms?
Loser.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Moving along quite well.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
So? How'd it go last night?
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Hi. Is Annette at home?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
What are saying, darling?
Mommy --
Where did you get this ring?
But where did you get it, Amy?
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
What is it, Alice?
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Where did you mail them?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
And who did the voice belong to?
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
These are all from me.
Daddy?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
That's right!
Oh, how beautiful!
May I pet the deer?
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Because it can't. It's dead.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
But I only came to give back the ring.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
Mommy read it to ne.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Good night, mother, good night.
What is it, ma'am?
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
No one I've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
There was a sale.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
Or if there's a full moon.
I think she broke the skin.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Maybe they have to pee.
Where?
He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
Are those Mark's?
What the hell is the tampon test?
Charming Carlton.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
You're such a good friend.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
What choice do we have?
I'm cleaning my stove.
I think George knows.
I wish I only had your problems.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You don't have to pee.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Uh huh. So pee.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Mark.
The Nielson's?
Coffee and...
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
You wanna get some coffee?
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
What's wrong?
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
Was there anything in that washer?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Uh.... hi!
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
What happened?
You didn't say it.
What's with the squirt guns?
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
I ate a guy last night.
No, it was our first date.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
It's for you. Frida.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
You think mafia hit?
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Sell maps?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Lost something?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Dammit!
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Who is it?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Why give yourself up?
People...  after me.
Where do you think this goes?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
Look!  This is a good one!
Where does it lead?
I didn't realise...
What does she say?  The woman.
If you like.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
Can I get my life back?
You've been working too hard.
What are you hiding?
How do you know I'm innocent?
Is this dangerous or anything?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
Right and don't embellish.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
What do you think you're doing?!
Die, you pond scum!
A condition...
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
Three years.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
I'll lock him away for good.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
We've got to fix this.
And it's proving quite effective...
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
They re not my attack dogs.
Yeah.
Really?
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
Who?
You bet.
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
You're leaving?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
Are you hungry?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
What's wrong?
Hi.
I never thought I'd...
It could be fun.
The Monroe?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Help me get him to the boat.
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
What is it?
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
Tonight?
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
What?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
NOOOOOOOOO!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
It's because of me.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
What'dya get?
You know how many demerits we're talking?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Charlie Dalton.
It will?  How do you figure?
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Yeah?  Like what?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Hey, he's your roommate.
Charlie...
You what?!  How did you do that?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Pleased to meet you.
That's your sister school, right?
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Chris!
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
What is that?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Again!  Louder!
LOUDER!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
But father, it's not fair.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Look at this.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
What?
Want to come to the study group?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Come on, that's impossible.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
And no questions asked.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Hanover, listen...
Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
You don't have to be so touchy.
I'm not rich people.
I don't know where it is!
Yeah you did...
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
The "come back" kind.
Looking good...
It's not them...it's it...
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
You want ME to go up there?
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Let's just keep going.
...Jagger was here...I was here...
I think he knows that Joey.
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Or maybe not.
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
She fucked you?
Fucking women, man...
You want 'em?
Yes, Albert?
Ammo! Get the ammo!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
I got delayed. I --
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Sure. Why not.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
No. None of that.
You are his friend.
You mean...?
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Linda...
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
What kind of beer would you like?
How are you?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Nick?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
I'm just so lonely.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Merle?
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
Is he from here?
It's ahead, by the tree.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Forget Sal.
Here, here! This is it!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
That's it. No. No way.
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
No!
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Down I would say... What would you say?
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Who is it?
My man Dubbs.
I'm not on the force anymore.
I'm wasting time.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
You my partner?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
See those guys?
They're going to rob that bank.
Wanna come?
Can I ask you something?
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
Good night, Wade.
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
What's this?
Yeah.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You be careful.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
Demolition Man.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
I'll take it.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Howdy, Jabez.
Loan shark -- hey?
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Stevens!
-- in gold.
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Where did it come from?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Coming along, Jabez?
But -- I was just lucky.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Well -- what are we going to do?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
You know that, son.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
What's that you say, Son?
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
I want you to fix these fish!
Hello, Sheriff.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
It is.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Jabez ...
Mr. Webster, I presume?
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
I'm John McClane.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
What's happening?
The police...?
You're very perceptive.
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
New York...
Bill, you know how to use a handgun?
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
I...have a request.
Go on.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
How do you know?
'Roy'.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Hey, you couldn't know.
This is --
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Aw, hey...
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Hey, don't take the car!
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
What guns?
How are you doing?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Yeah... yeah.
What kind of things, Leon?
Who's this?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Sonny-boy, one word?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You frisk me.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
Calm down, you're not ...
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
You got kids?
What?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
What is it, Sam?
It's up to you ladies.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
How did you know your son was involved?
Did you always call him Junior.
I used to, but I stopped.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Ah, Jesus...
He's gone?
Where's the money?
You mean that?
I want him to think that.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
What?
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Oh - Maria!
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
Fuck!  We did it!
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Oh my God, mother!
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
Morning.
What is it, Choco?
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Where are we going?
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
Is that you, Domino?
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Cunt.
Cunt.
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Many times.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
So?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
How much?
Don't come back, either.
No, you the man.
It's been about a year.
How long?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
I thank you.
Good morning.
Where did you sleep?
No.
Nice!
This might take some time.
I'll do.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
It's a fucking shame.
Sweet Dick Willie.
It's dug.
ML?
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
C'mon, Sal.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Hot.  Hot.
Shit!  I forgot.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
What else?
Later for you.
Feels good.
Where are you going?
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
You talk to 'em.
I didn't know you could read.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Mookie's OK.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
The both of youse, shaddup.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Take it easy, Pop.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Hi.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
You did?
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
What?
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
The name's Walter.
Mom, you know that never works.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
Home school? What's that?
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
What?
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I will stop this car right now.
You take that back!
Collins is a great man!
No.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Can he do that?
I don't know. Owwww.
My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
Who's your partner?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
HARRY, can you hear me?
But-
George Washington!
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
But my mom gave me the map.
I made the polar bear pants.
Ready Lloyd?
Guys, this is much better.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
What?
Sorry, Charlie.
You had some questions.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
What are you doing here?
What?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
So, when can we do it?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Well, something stinks.
I'm so close I can feel it.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Okay.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
I am strong!
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
What papers?
The evidence of what?
This is horse?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
We have just folded space from Ix...
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
As the legend says.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Why do they come?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
THE PAIN!
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Uh, beg to differ.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Are you sure this is okay?
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
What is this place?
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Why are you here??
Don't worry.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Will he be okay?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
You're a fuckin' mess.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Yeah...?
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
I like to think so.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
My eyes are killink me.
Excuse me, Sir...?
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Can I help you?
Is there a script?
Lugosi?
Isn't he dead?
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Hello.
I got married last night.
Oh.  Okay.
What was that?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
You're sure this is gonna work?
You're <u>sure</u>???
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
Why... yes.
Wow.
Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
So?
Ed, can I see you a second.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
He's who we want to go with.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Take him off the air.
Where are you going?
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Send him away.
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
Who?
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Are you asking me?
What does this mean?
How much less?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
So...?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
You know, that would be like a great thing.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
All right.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Hi.
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
You brought the girl!
Look, we gotta talk.
Good-bye, brother!
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
You know what your problem is?
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Can I help with anything?
We don't have foibles.
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
How?
By the X.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
What?
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
Larry?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
I guess you know why you're here
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
What a surprise.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Could you get this? I can't
More this way.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Where 're you going?
What...?
People can see this.
These are private -- these are for us.
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
How's the left these days?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Look.  I want to see you again.
I don't know.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
Did you talk to Exley?
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Will you work for me?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Why?
Dudley.
Dudley's guys.
You expecting problems?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Thanks, but no thanks.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
Dudley, we've been over this.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
L.A.P.D.
Damnit...
Glasses.
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
What's that for?
Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
She is Lana Turner.
What are you going to do?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
Really?  What did White say?
I'll take your word for it.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
Where will you go?
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
My daughter was a virgin!
Around.
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Brill?
What'd he give to you?
Someone else?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
I'll come straight there.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
You knew the deal. No contact.
Yes.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
What if--
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
What do you think?
Gimme that.
Drive.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Goddammit--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Is it okay?
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
I think she'll like this very much.
A police report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
Than why can't you tell me.
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
I'm sorry.
Who did you work with to get the--
Sorry.
Stacy?
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Does that hurt?
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
The lingerie.
Who?
My suitcase--
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
And then what?
Brill?
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I gotta go.
You being audited?
Rachel--
I can't.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
This conversation's over.
Any idea what he looks like?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
He didn't.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Robert--
Some of 'em.
How long can you stay?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
Can I talk to you a second?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
Yes.
I don't know!
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
It's been a few years.
What does that have to do with you?
You think there was a connection to--
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What happened?
The originals?
Am I to understand--
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
How'd you get in the building?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Which stall?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
You sing.  All the time.
You should come into the shelter.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Don't.
I'm impressed you can sew.
What else?
Don't leave me!
Tell me about your garden.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Good morning!
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Why do they care about our maps?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
David Caravaggio.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Who are his ghosts?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Hello.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Irving Berlin.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
What did you say?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Lady H said she thought you might be -
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
He's Canadian.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
I'll probably marry him.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
For my hair?
Kip - come and dance with me
I mean home.  India.
It's what I've learned.
And what if he really is a spy?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
No.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
We've got to catch him in the act.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Where are you at least?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
I don't want to waste your time.
Are you...okay?
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
I've got something...
I've got something for you.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
Fine. What do I do?
What the hell do I do now?
What about your bags?
Those are my clothes.
That's entrapment.
Lose something?
You're late.
Nice spot.
I know it well.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
True enough.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
Someone was expecting that.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
Let's do it again.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
I trust it's your size.
Thank you.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
You're nervous again.
He wasn't.
We did it.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
We're living history here.
Hmmm...44 long.
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
What's that?
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Got it.
That's where the Mask comes in.
Parachute.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Jesus God, it's going through.
Relax, don't jam it...
Jesus.
Come on.
Hang on.
What's wrong.
--You're a cop.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Always in a rush.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
This is just show and tell.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You'll just have to have faith.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Tony Marvin.
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
This is a real nice place you got here.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
What's chromium?
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
The judge came up with a number.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Out to lunch with the girls.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
This is the only thing you found?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
What do you mean?
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
I'll see what I can do.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Counts?
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
And if you had to guess ...
So why would PG&E offer it?
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
I don't know what to say.
I did.  Both.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Two million dollars?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Ross.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
Can I play roller hockey?
She's one of the sick people?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Whose number do you need?
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
No.
What're you doing?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
Thank you.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Where's my paycheck?
There's something else, too.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Wow, that's soon --
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
He will learn patience.
Will he finish what he begins?
I can't ...
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Barks a blue streak.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks at his master.
... the power?
Give me that!
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
The temperature is dropping too fast.
Our destruction?  Who?
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
They're moving away.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
That depends.  Where are we?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
It's a lovely outpost.
What about Han?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
This hyperdrive had better work.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
That they are.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
But tell me why ...
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Good God.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
Humans?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Give it.
Oh Cuervo...
He's... near.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
Shut up, Plissken.
Get this crap out of me.
I'll need to know more about this thing.
Defense against what?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
Where do I put ashore?
She's in the green.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Getting ready to invade.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Location.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
How do we get out of here?
What are you gonna do in Venice?
All of us?
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Who is Merlin?
You saved me from the arrow...
A king must marry, after all.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
At your service, sir.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
Who is, then?
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
And you cannot love me...
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Why?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Very well. Climb up.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
Well why are they tearing the building down?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Hi
And you got an invitation.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
Where do you want this?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
It's serious?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
No. No rats.
Morning.
How are you today?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
About my daughter?
He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
I didn't get you?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
No, is Regan aware of it?
Yes. He's already here.
What did you do today?
Oh look at that.
You really don't want me to play huh?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Hi Chris. Great party.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get it then?
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Withering Heights.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
You'd like that?
Do it again.
What's that?
Is that too tight?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Save your servant
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
The Lord be with you.
Amen.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
It's possible. Possible however…
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Who?
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
...look down in pity...
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Are you comfortable Regan?
What's this?
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Trunks?
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
Count it.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
It was an accident.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
You gotta go.
Your older brother.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
No?
What was it like?
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Where the hell is she?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
You hit me.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
See anything?
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Day.  Wednesday.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Have some more wine, Frank.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
You leaving that on?
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
How dare you say you love me.
How's it coming?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
The party's over.
They were simple songs.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
Cancel, Frank.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Fuck you.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Sick?  How sick?
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
When?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
That!  You can't wear that!
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
What do you think?
Shoes?
Fucking.
Maybe it's legit.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Great?
Peggy Lee?
Some discussion.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Brought it.
He takes after our mother.
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Forget it.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
History.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
The both of them?  In there?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
You can always get another girl.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
I'm late for surgery.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Whoever you are, don't call again.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Now what?
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
You killed them?
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Clarissa left those here.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
You always call me Miss Brewster.
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
What's that?
-- what?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Her assistant?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Why Jack?
That’s right. And auto supply...
Rise...and...shine...!
They did a pretty good job.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
We’re friends, aren’t we?
I’m having kind of a bad day.
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
She said that?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
How’d you know my name?
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
You just said everyone needs something.
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
What're you talkin' about?
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Are you okay?
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Uh...that baby’s crying...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
No?
Excuse me?
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
Our life in a nutshell...
C’mon.
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
Jack...can we afford all this?
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Are you out of your mind?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
Don’t do that...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
I promise, Jack...
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Not by a long shot.
Can I help you?
Last night was great...
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
That’s totally see through...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
I mean...
I can't take this.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Where...where am I?
What's wrong with me?
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
I'll be watching over you.
About me?  How sweet.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
He's not responsive --
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Back it down, Johnny!
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
How's the IPO?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Front page?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
Not until Ben is back inside!
But I'm not done with the machine --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
For science.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
It's just business.
Victor, I'm sorry I --
You said it was urgent.
Please don't make this personal --
What're you getting at?
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Yes, Alan.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
Difficult? He's impossible!
Listen...the Heart.
Doctor...
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
Look at that...they're changing color...
What do you mean?
We can't take a second more.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
What's that?
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Tell them to take us out.
There it is!
You have no right to blame Duval --
Looks like quite a way to go...
Atomic fuel?
All in all, quite a canoe...
Any reserve air?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
That's it...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
This is a new car, then, sir?
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
Unguent.
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
...Blood has been shed.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, don't be silly.
How ya doin'?
Yah.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Just a general way.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
You're not a C student.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
but do you know that for sure without -
Yah, but -
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
Yah, so we're all set.
Stan Grossman called.
Twice.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Carl somethin'?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
...Geez.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
No, that's okay.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
...What can I get ya?
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Better times.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Yep.
Nope.
Hello?
Yah?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
So... they didn't...
Oh. Geez.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Uh-huh.
Oh, my.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
What... ?
There's no one else here.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
We need to talk.
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I'll take the parasites.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
I don't know ...
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Where?  Here?
Uh ... nah.
That... sawing and hammering.
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
I'm sorry, I...
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
Tyler?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Well, uh... great.
What list?
Don't I?
I don't follow...
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
A nice, big cock.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
I know that.
You?
Promise?
Huh?
What is this place?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
We don't need him...
No thanks, I quit.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
What are we doing?
What are you talking about?
"Too young?"
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think anything?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Ask me nicely.
What?
Why... why... why... ?
What are you doing?
Appreciate something.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Robert Paulson?
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Ain't that something?
Did you hear what I just said?!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Please, what else could it mean?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
Six duds in a row.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
I'm not sure I understand.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Tell me again how it started.
You mean Alex Browning.
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Stop it, don't move him!
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
Mom?
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
4:25.
Police are coming.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
And don't pass on the right.
Knock it off!
Get control of yourself!
You mean the snake?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
You okay?
Batteries not included.
What's this?
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's that?
How you doing, Brewer?
I'm getting him out.
You better take off.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Why's that?
Where did you find this clown?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Intelligence work.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
Why'd they want us?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Invulnerable.
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
What was that?
John.  My name is John.
Why me?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
Typical...
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
How long have you been setting up?
Hello, John.
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Fine.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
See, I told you!
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
What?
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
What if I was a relative?
You a friend of Parry's?
Can I help you?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Remember. One chorus and out.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Yes.
A list.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Please don't hurt me?
Have I died?
Where -- ?
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
Will you shut-up!!!
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
It's such a great song.
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
You a fag too?
I advise you to let us go.
Parry Parry?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
Well, it's enough for me.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
You're not going to play it again.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I did, didn' I, El?
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
You're depressed that I come along.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Rayette.
Bobby...
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Wasn't it, ladies?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Tea.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Oh.
Daddy's very ill.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
Maybe you better stay, then.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Swimming?
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Catherine...
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
No, I can't...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
You better hold onto your tongue!
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Miss Dupea.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
What?
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Wussup?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
So you got a girl?
So what you think of me?
Come down!
So what girls are over there?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Yo, that's my girl.
My friend told me she lived around here.
So what do you want with her anyway?
You live around here?
Maybe tonight?
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
No children?
Jesus.
The two surfer boys?
You find the source?
Are you all right, Doctor?
Here you are, Doctor.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Good evening.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
My parents were great fans of the former President.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Why are they after you?
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
We can't talk about it here.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
So why pick me?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Yo!
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Magic' today, huh?
Shoot.
Cute young thing, too.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Hi.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Why'd you let me in?
What about his parents?
Thanks for the great time.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
So?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
No.
I'm terrified.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
You want I set up?
Muchas gracias.
I commend him on his choice.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
Fletch.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
What's the spread on the game tonight?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
So let's go! We run the pictures.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Gummy and two cops...
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
How could you call him?
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Who's Frieda?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Ah, an obvious choice.
I came to warn you...
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Three hundred.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Let's get serious...
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
This way...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Ick.
I can't kill this kid's father...
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Ouch.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Yeah, go on...
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Two words.  Disco Express.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Shit.
You'd said something about proof...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
That's cute.  You're funny.
How nice.
'Bye, Johnny...
What's my name?
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Did you pick up the car?
Did they follow you?
It has to be by the end of this week.
It's your problem.
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Comment va-t-elle?
It's beautiful.
You're in show business.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
Why not?
You got the warrant?
You want the red or the white?
What about Sal?
Timezit?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Yeah.
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
Where's the collar, in the cells?
How do we get to the vault door?
It looks open on the other side.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
I'm off.
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
About what?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
I swear, Satch.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
Uh, hello?
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
What'd you say your name was?
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
What's going on?
That's impossible.
It's really you, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
But that's tomorrow.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
I'll warn them.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
What do I tell them?
Got it.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
You all right?
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
What?
He took your wallet?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Sull!  What the hell!
How you feeling?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
I better give you my address then.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Which means he probably knew her.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
Got a minute?
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
No kiddin'?
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Breakfast?
Why don't we go take a swim?
What're you doin'?
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
No.  I got here just before you did.
What happened that night?
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Oh, jeez.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
Whaddya mean?
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
But, Dad, we...
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
No.  No, it's not...
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
There...Ya happy?
Why?
Okay, give it back.
So what happened?
Where'd you get this?
But what if they try and scare us?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Which is?
He didn't say anything?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Yes!
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
I'm kind of busy right now...
Look, I don't want your money!
Legs giving you trouble?
Steven buggin' you?
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
That's very colorful, chief.
It was a community service.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
I know what it sounds like.
I didn't kill her!
Look, I know I treated her bad --
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
That was truly excellent.
What's wrong?
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Christ...where's Rennie??
You have no right...
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
I can't swim.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
I heard you weren't coming.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rennie...??
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
What about her?
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
She is kicking you out.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
What else?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
Opening night, Lillian.
And you've been extremely patient.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
Who is it?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
Let's not start that again.
Where's your elastic brace?
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
You're a family man, Frankie?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Postpone. We have every right.
Why?
Yes.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
Mine was cobalt blue.
This could be it.
And he has finer moments now and then.
So do I. Over and over.
Do you think he can do it?
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
What was he like?
What'd he say?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
And Jinnah?
What do you want?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Perhaps some tea?
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
No?  What's keeping you?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
From what budget?
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
German.
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
Call German.
Come on--we're taking off.
They'll recognize me.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
How are you, Jerome?
How the hell did you get here.
Why have you done this?
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.

Yeah.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Of course I think about it every day.
Why are we leaving?
What about the car?
I can't.
What is it?
--when you go away.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
Flight got you nervous?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
The name?  For the certificate.
You gotta be kidding.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
I'll take care of my end.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
You want to drive?
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
You been okay?
Boring.
You go out much?
I'll be okay.
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
I didn't. I just waited.
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
Promise you won't laugh.
They checked in.
Why?
Yeah.
There better be a guy with the
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
What?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We're going to make it.
No more about Beynon.
Sounds good.
Can we make it?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Yeah. I got out.
Two.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
Let's just get to the border.
Which way?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
What's the damage?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I've got to stop.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Oh ay?
Well, he drove it into the river.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Where's he living these days?
She's nothing to do with me.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Though nicer than most?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
He was here for four days.
Who's setting you up in this place?
Is he coming here?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
Then he must have pulled her.
Now tell me the truth.
Have another?
How's school?
That must be interesting.
You coming to South America?
Where you going to live, then?
You work here, Keith?
What happened to you, then?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
What is it?
Now just a minute...
Are you awake?
Is he?
What's it to you anyway?
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Four hundred?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
It is.
It's not.
And it's not right to the customers.
...that's right...
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
Starting up.
You...
They have...
Somebody...
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
As an idea.
You didn't?
You're going to steal the leads?
Did I say that?
Is that what I said?
Yes.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
I didn't ask to be.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Were the leads...
They aren't?
Yes.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Did the leads come in yet?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
That's great.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
Who used to say that?
What?
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Who told you...?
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
John.  John...
Why?
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
Of what?
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
Now?  Now?
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
That's alright.
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
Get 'em to me!
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Yes.  I hear you.
Why I don't...
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
It was his idea.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
Abso...
Don't.
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Shit.
When?
Fuck you care...?
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Home...
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I'm sorry...?
Yeah.
Yes.
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
No, Jim.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
What...?
The deal.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Fuck you.
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
They took some of the con...
Where are you going?
Aren't you going out today?
...you want to go out today...?
Yes.
Did you see my present for you?
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Is Kay coming?
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
You would risk your life for strangers?
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
I understand...
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
That's what I'm here for.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
That's off now.
He's not the same as when I met him.
Where's my wife?
You're going to talk to him now.
Me too, Tom?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
I asked about Fredo?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Was it a boy or a girl?
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
Fifteen percent skim?
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Is he related to the witness?
How's the baby?
Where can we talk?
There are still things I have to do.
No, I meant lose his family.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
I know.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
He supports me.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Thanks, doll.
This looks corny.
So what did you think?
I wasn't going to try anything.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
You and he are not doing things?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
These are your paintings?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
I suppose you'd like the top down.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
That only leaves the rest.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
Storm's getting worse.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
You remember what the doctor tells us.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Does the yardman come today?
Who was that at the door?
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
What are you doing here?
Who was the job for?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
I'm not interested --
Sound it out for me.
Well, that certainly won't do.
You have my word...
I know you.
What are you still doing here, Randall?
What do you want from me?
Who is it -- ?
Got it ...
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
What about him?
What color?
Forget that ...
How's it going -- ?
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I know...
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Any more, O -- ?
Whatcha got left ... ?
We'll take it...
You goin' home?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Hey, Kip ...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
You can handle it?
What are you doing here?
Having fun, Kip?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
Toby...
What are you doing here?
You boost her -- ?
You okay -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
How's it going?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Hey.
I go with you --
You mentioned that in your letters
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Hear you roar ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
This time it's for real?
She does have one thing you don't.
Whatever do you mean?
You think it can be done?
Some crew you got ...
How old are you now, Toby?
What do you want, shithead?
What are you doing here, assface?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Anybody!  You understand?
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
What do you do?
Go inside. I'll be right there.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
What are you talking about?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What about the schools?
Keep 'em coming.
Watch this.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
I want to talk to Jimmy.
Where'd you find such creeps?
You ready?
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
The third store down.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What do we got?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Thanks, Chuck.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
What class?
Oh...
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
Hi.
Oh, right.
WILL!
How much money you got?
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Did she get my Double Burger?
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Holy shit.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
You want us to give you cash right now?
I don't think I...Larry?
Will you take a check?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
--That edge!
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
What are you smiling at?
Will.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Good to meet you.
So who won the bet?
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I got it.
Would you excuse us?
Why would he do that?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
So I hear you're taking some time.
I got one of those too.
About thirty million to one.
What do you want to do?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Yeah, I read those.
That must have taken you a long time.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Crayons?
What is?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
Why thank you.
Well, are you going out again?
Why not?
My wife's dead.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
When did you know she was the one?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
They could see that I meant it.
Don't fuck with me.
That's what you want?
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
I swear to God.
Where have you been?
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
Why do we always stay here?
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
I don't know. I just feel it.
Why not?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Maybe the road's out.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Short fella. Pale face.
Kinda pie y'got?
So long.
Two and a half cents.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Deputy sheriffs.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
That cut you got?
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Is it fur?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
Been doin' a job?
You ain't got to get sore.
I didn't mean nothing.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Where you going?
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Jus' sassy, that's all.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Ma, you sick?
Looks like you done it.
They know he got hit in the face.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
What's this?
You people looking for work?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
You look beautiful.
...Let me get my coat.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
No time.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Will you come with me?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Thank you, no.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Well?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
They were very upset.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
It didn't work out.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
How are you? How's business?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Shit.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Thanks.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Just make yourself comfortable.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
How long is this going to go on?
I don't believe this!
Did he tell you that?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
When? Tonight?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Let's bring your bags inside.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
David?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I'm sorry.
I should go get some of her things.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
How was the dinner?
What was I saying?
You've already made arrangements!?
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
Huh-huh. You?
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Where does this go, Diane?
They fired you?
Frank's a good man.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
What?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
- See, what you can do for him --...
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
I don't believe it.
Tom?
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Of course I have.
Mmm. An editor.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Don't be such a baby!
You think it's cool?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
She's rabid, but cute.
Oh yeah? What's that?
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Right.
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
One-handed!
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
Dead.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
How was school?
Shit! Come on!
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
I found it! I found it!
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Two days.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
He's not in this class.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
Yeah.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
There they are!
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Good.
You're welcome.
Mr. Belford?
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
What is he doing in here?
Any questions?
You think they're going to bust us?
A hacker planted the virus.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Just one moment.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
I'll take you down there.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
We need to talk.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
What's going on?
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Mom, please
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Why shouldn't I?
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Do you?
You look sharp. You understand?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Something?
This is starting to spook me.
Is that him? Is that him?
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Okay.
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
You're going to be late!
Sure.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Look.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Annie, was that you?
Sure, see you later.
You still spooked?
Lies.
Probably Mister Riddle.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Fancy.
You idiot!
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
Is that all you say?
My parents won't be back till ten.
We're all alone, aren't we?
Anybody live here?
A man wouldn't do that...
Sure...
Exactly what do you need?
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Is Annie around?
Okay. Later.
Are you coming over tonight?
Can we watch the monster movies?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
What about the bogyman?
No...
Are you sure?
I'm scared!
Hello.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
If you say so.
I love that.  That's my type.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Uh, who gets dropped first?
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Oh, geez, yeah.
You're joking.
But I'm seeing him.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
You're Holly.
Yeah.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Hi, Dusty.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
We--
Like, uh...?
Yeah.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
How about you?
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Where are you headed?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Uh, yes!
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Elliot!
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Lee... uh...
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Is something wrong?
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
But it hasn't been forever. 
Mm-hm?
You bet.
Are you in a bad mood?
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Oh, Mom!
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
So?
How do you know?
Are you sure?
Hmm?
Me?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
What are you going to use for money?!
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Yeah.  What?
Yes!
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
So how are you?
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
How is everything?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Go right over there.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Ohh?
Don't you think she does?
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Frederick didn't come with her.
He's such a loser!
Oh, he's such a loser!
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Awwww...
Boy--
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
At least I'm open to new concepts!
God!
You look wonderful.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
No, the reason I ask is--
You're kidding me.
Oh, I'm fine.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Well, what about me?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Hi.  How you doin'?
When'd you get here?
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Aren't you glad to see me?
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
...how are things at the Hospital?
We could skip the Gavotte.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
You want to get married...?
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
What else did I miss...?
First things first.
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
<u>Do</u> it...
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
You give me whatever I want...?
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
What reaction?
...here's to child abuse!
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Sir:
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
A fellow with five fingers.
No. 
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
What'd you say, hon...?
I said how's your baby...?
My husband brought it to me from America.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Of course, Commendatore...
...yes.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
Make them eat the figurine.
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
And you let her get away.
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
I came to pay my...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
...when I... 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
Give me your gun...
"Because we don't have any money."
...<u>sadly</u>...
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Then what brings you back?
Yes.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
My encounter.
...sir...?
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Now what? What did I do this time?
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Man, she's losing it...
Freeze!  You're busted!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
That would be a No.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Yeah. I guess I do.
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]
Fuck off.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
God, you're beautiful.
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
I said I was sorry.
Veronica, you look like hell.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
Shit.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Do you take German?
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
Did you miss him completely?
Did to.
Your son's dead and you love him.
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
You know what I want, babe?
Let's kick his ass.
You going to eat this?
Answer him dick!
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
What now?
Bye.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
He's the manager!
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
I'm educating myself!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
I'm so happy to see you!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
I think I'm dying . . .
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
To be known as He!
Him.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
But that's not true! I've got one.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
No.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Since what?
I have my connections
GWEN?
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
What's wrong, Trev?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
You win! Okay pull over.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
Never to put you in my will.
You're alive...
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Poor Trevor.
Dreams?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
Last week...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
You okay?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
I...
He waited for you three hours!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
You!
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
It's not right, Gale...
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
That too.
She wants to quit?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
It's not unthinkable.
He lost a shoe!
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
So where are all your toys?
How's the new place?
And the rent is okay?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Right.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
Baby, what is it?
Mommy!
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Whew.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Neil -- what --
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
I thought we'd be happy here.
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
How large is your brood?
Let's follow 'em.
Shit!
Are we gonna buy this house?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Neil, do you mind?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Really?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
Tough.
This ties in with Nash.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Detective Bedsoe.
Where were you last night around nine?
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
Where have you been for the last seven years?
She was a good woman.
You sure?
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Must you do that?
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
I'm leaving.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
What are we doing here?
To ask her to dance.
Yes.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
You can go first.
How comes it your are not afraid?
I cannot stay.
Why?
Do you love me, Conner?
Then take me with you.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Yes.  How did you know?
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
No.
Good evening.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Why not?
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
He's in there!
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
What are you doing?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
What will you do?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
What'd you find out?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
You get anything on Smith?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Bullshit!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Jesus.  What is this?
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
Then we might as well die rich.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
We're cool.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
We been through that.  Forget it.
Let me come get him.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
What about my father?
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
The cops are comin'!
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Can you identify this man?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
All right.  Now the second one.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
No one's coming.
I'm not gonna leave you!
You leave that gun alone!
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Kevin left without you.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
What's going on?
Smith!  Wake up!
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's enough.
Is something wrong with Jane?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
He didn't say.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
You want me to stick around, I could --
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
The kids are in here!
What do you want me to do?
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Who are you?
Marlon and Al....
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
What happened?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Paul!
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Excuse me?
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Give me it.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Paul, you know who this is?
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Anything. Strong.
What is it?
The United Nations are still here.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
You lie.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Holy shit! Holy shit.
You fucking see that!
Very soon.
Mr. Manager.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Are you sure this is the river road?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
What do you want?
Our cards, please.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
No.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
What is it, Paul.
What!
You could leave, Paul.
Go to the roof now.
I have a confession. When we met...
I had you transferred to Kigali.
Let me go. Children get off.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Can I have your name again?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
That is why they call it coach?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
Paul. Are you alright?
The staff and guests! How many?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
It's complicated. But don't worry --
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Jesus H. Christ!
More the merrier.
There must be some other way out.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry --
This thing's going nowhere.
-- I did: down here.
'Less the place really is haunted.
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
What's down there?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
-- the stained glass --
-- closed.
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Or an on-line computer.
What?
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
I'm ready now.
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
I think...I may have the answer.
What're you talking about?
-- the window and door grates --
I'll take my chances.
Please! I need your help.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Rewind that.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
And you think it's in there?
There is something very not normal going on here!
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Sara...?
Damn it.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Did you find her?!
Where does this amulet come from?
By freeing them.
Well then who did?!
It's going to hurt us!
Can you talk to her?
What about all my other stuff?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
She's down.  Help her...
Mommy please help me!
It's just going to take a while.
But do you agree with me?
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Are you all right?
We don't know.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Your daughter's been taken.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
You must be the new tenants.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
Keep talking!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
There's something through that wall!
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
How have you ... ?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Sure.  Why?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
Joey?
JP?
You're apologizing?
I miss you too.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
Alex, are you....
My life is not some deal.  I...
Welcome back to Vinci.
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
No, let me!
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
If you do anything to my friend...
Something short.
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
A sawbuck!
-- and she's dynamite!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
Hungry, anyway.
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Cigarette?
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Oh, is that it!
...Huh?
...The people look like ants.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
You can't print that!
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
...Geez.
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Awwww, buddy --
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Finally.
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Yellowstone.
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
That will mean another interview, won't it?
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
It is not beautiful.
Can't I take it for you?
Why was the maid crying?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I suppose so.  Yes.
I heard you playing.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
I don't know -- I don't know--
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
Investigation of what?
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
What do you think?
You all right there?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You crying?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Don't start.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Elena.
I'm fine dad.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Here.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
A prior engagement overcame me.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Good-night dad.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Good shit.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Hi mom.
I saw you on your bike today.
Mikey Williams?
Please don't.
I used to know how to cook.
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Now you are being rude.
Flame on, asshole.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
No candy for me?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
How do you know this shit?
No one.
You have to follow me?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
When worlds collide.
You get in trouble?
Charles.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Just thought I'd stop by.
He's dead.
Yes, sir.
Good.
Do it again.
This murder was in the papers, right?
What about your shoulder?
Who was the last one to see her alive?
What are you doing here?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
So?
Where you signed this?
That's right.
He's just rattling your cage.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Fred Duggar?
Will...I...
Will.
You heard me that time.
How should I know?...
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
You and Kay were like sisters?
You gave her gifts.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
What about him?
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Your lips, they didn't move.
That is a picture, nothing more.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
Then blame the one who made her...
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
I couldn't prevent it.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
I want more.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
What was that?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
You know her?
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Do you think I would let them harm you?
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
They would have killed you -
What do you want from me?
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
You really want to be with them?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
Lestat - finish this -
She's here, your wounded one.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
It's only a siren...
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
You loved Yvette...
And did you lose her? Did she go?
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
You promise to care for her then?
And the child who did die?
You're in 201 and 202.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Storm season?
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
I thought you were out of town!
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Okay, okay. You're right.
I'm the King of the World.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
No way.
Nice move.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
Julie?
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Never do that again.
It was one year ago...
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
What do you mean, Julie?
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
There was a body! I swear it!
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Why are you doing this to me?
...Why?
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
He leave you?
What's going on?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
Goodbye.
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
You're just talking nonsense.
) You feel the symptoms?
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
What are you doing?
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
You are fortunate in your father.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
I have forgotten it, dear.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
I felt he did not like me.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Theodosia.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
I have had command for the last time —-
Theodosia --
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
But they're somebody's children.
Get that ladder up here.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
What'd you say?
What did you say?
You have no car.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
I . . .
Hey, who's that?
Splendid! Is he sick?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Well?
Today, over at the house.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
It will?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Goodbye, everybody!
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Oh . . .
Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Anything I can do back here?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
I know, but . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Well, what do you know –– wife.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Well, hello.
I'm not very good at this.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Eighteen.
Too young or too old?
What'd you wish, George?
I'll take it. And then what?
Ouch!
Where'd you get that dress?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Oh, Mary . . .
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Where's your coat and hat?
Oh, George, George!
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Oh, shit.
Get on the rocks!
Yeah, it's her job.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Why'd they decide to move?
Coming up!  Give way!
I don't know.
Hey!
On your own time?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
How long ago?
You're too close.  Back off.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Do I have to?
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Dad, I'm sorry....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Let's get the kid home.
Need a ride?
Eat Cheerios.
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
All summer?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
That you were fired.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I know you did....
What is it?  What's the matter?
We're alone.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Did you say Cable Junction?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
We're going to die.
I want you to meet my cousin.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Give me back my hat!
But first, a little juice....
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
It'll be fun, come on!
I thought you were grounded.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
He's got to help or it won't work.
Who wouldn't.
They're turning around.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Oh, my God....
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
Go on, you're tired.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
He's going with you, Doctor.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
Well, not much longer to go.
That macho pompous English --
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
And leave me down here???
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
You all right?
How the hell did it get in here?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Here.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
You want me to stay?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I told you, something's upset them.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
I will.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
Why?
How's sleeping beauty?
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
I like it when they wake up.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
When did this happen?
Give me a ride?
Musclehead?
So, you just get here?
Sure am.
Herpes?
Besides that.
Let's go, let's go!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Gotta sneeze.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Did you see that?
Yes, there is goes.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Polar bears.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Look great, don't I?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
How come it's my responsibility?
Turn it off....
Where's my mother?
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Stop that....
That hurt....
Yes!
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I almost forgot....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
I'll be all right, Michael.
I want you to give up your work....
You could teach...You could....
I enjoy his company....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Can you just go off...?
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
It was no accident....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're impossible....
I'm fine.
A drink with an umbrella in it....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
You sure you don't need glasses?
I'll get it back next time.
Want to go for a little ride?
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
You the architect?
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Matt?
I wish there was something I could do....
How many...?
I know how to tag a damn conch....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Okay...we got it together....
How long have you known Hoagie?
I'm coming...How close is it?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
I don't like the song.
Holy Christ....
All the time....
Woman has taste....
That bad, huh?
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
How's the new residence?
What time is it?
There's nothing in the files?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
What do you mean?
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
Ease off, John ..
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Listen, you don't havta come?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
Have you got a print from the hand?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Is this normal?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
No.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
What color was it?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Just your age.
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Why can't I stay with you?
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
You got a warrant for this?
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
You think John would like it?
You want something, darling?
Shut up, King Jay ..
You can drive down there, Sir ..
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Well, no you didn't --
I just heard.
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Listen to me!
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
... this is... uh... too funny...
Oh no.
It's all going to work.
Oh my God.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
-- especially one like this.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Yeah, I did.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Sure you're okay to drive this?
If I said that, would you stay?
I don't need you to "stick."
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
Wait. Where is he?
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
I heard.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
That's the girl I love.
First you gotta tell me something.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
You love me now, don't you?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
No, I air-dry.
You're telling me to dance.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
The kid is amazing.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
That's an answer.
I think so.
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
I'll go back to them.
Marcee --
I'm fine.  What's up?
Pardon me?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
You wanted smaller.
I don't see any.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
We can't just...
Sorry.
You look good.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Young adult.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
I don't remember
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
We should try fishing again.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
That does sound lucky.
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
Bonitas.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Hmmm.
That's hard to believe.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
How did you know?
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
What?
What are you talking about?
I don't believe you.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
How could you possibly?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
What is that?
It's... behind... us.
She's gutty.
There' no reason for name calling.
What do they want?!
Come on!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
Something's wrong.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
So what's your story, Nick?
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Ask her.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
How long will this take?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh, shit.
Constantly sick.
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
C'mon on, this way.
No. We can't.
And scary.
It's anti-nature.
Alan, listen to this.
Unpredictability....
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
Why not?
Up and down, up and down!
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
Tim.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Ah - - they're here.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
What's that?
Let's go!
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
Jesus Christ!
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
It's still on.
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Sorry.
Doesnit sleep?
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
How do we prove it?
How long will he need to be asleep?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Add it to the list.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Are you all right?
What happened? Where's Jason?
You work in the insurance department?
Have you worked here long?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
-- Eduard --
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Hello again.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Are you free tonight?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
Probably not.
I'll bear that in mind.
That's <u>mad</u>.
-- You seem amused.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
It's gone out so quickly?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Women are all you have on your mind!
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
They were just tasting the berries.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Did you fear for your life?
Are you gonna start it up?
Why?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Why isn't he locked up?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Who?
Gee.
Why?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
What? This?
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
What're you gonna do next?
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
You and I -- a relationship.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
You were hired to look for Tom.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
John, how are you?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Town Police.
We grew up together. Kids.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Think this is our guy?
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Ladies and gentlemen...
What about my orange juice?
Okay...Same as usual...
I think I'm going to throw up.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Daddy?
I'm sorry...
See you in the morning light.
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
Is this really your desk?
Are you going to get remarried?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
What don't you understand, pal?
Your mom.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Objection.
Objection!
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Was he unfaithful?
I was not a failure.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
How's the new job?
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
So...what's so terrible about that?
Three months.  How can you tell?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
John?
How many?
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Things? What kind of things?
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
What are you going to do?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You're on your own, understand?
You ever think about getting married again?
California?
Thelma, if I die--
Mama, my story.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
Not the way to talk to people.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
And the United Nations? Surely?
With much bloodshed.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Me. First break of day.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I will be back in a few days.
Do I have money?
How big is Tibet's army?
What can I do? I am only a boy.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
What is the size of our army, now?
Has anyone died?
Did you ever doubt it?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
Things change, Kundun.
It is a story, you decide.
Yes.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
Tell me.
I do.
No.
You killed him.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
It seems like we're getting lower.
Go!!!
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
What's that?
I can arrest you!!
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
The more he thrashes, the better.
You take care.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
With crocodiles... everything's even.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
What?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Why are you here?  Really.
I'm not making it up.
In Maine?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
You flew up here because your boss--
Okay.  We're up at six.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
<u>Are</u> you okay?
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Like little children.  You okay?
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Sorry.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
I'm not mushing it.
Calm down.
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
It can't work.
Watch out!!
We gotta get to Hector!!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Different worlds, Jack.
You think?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
What's that?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
You said nobody came in here!
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
What?
They don't believe her.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Are you alright?
Are you okay?
Did you get him?
Should I?
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Are you on drugs?
I'm not even a field person.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
Boy, is that smart...
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Lecter said a lot of things.
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
You're all right! Where is he?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
You seem pretty sure of that.
What would it take?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
Yes.
They all were.
A moth... How did you predict that?
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I - ran away...
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
So you ran away...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Thank you, Clarice.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Yes, miss.
What is it?
And my compliments to you...
Will you go back to England?
You still have an aversion to the water?
How far is it, scout?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
How long?
Where do we go from here?
Then what?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
What happened to you?
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Excuse me. What did you say?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
What's wrong?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
It's got Hazy!
That's an order!
Where the hell've you been?
You did good...
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
What about our quota?
I'm going inside.
Twenty minutes...
Okay, number 23's full.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Listen to it for Christsake.
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
Getting some food.
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Clear for pickup.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What on earth's the matter with you?
What is it?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Bitch!  Look what you did!
What's wrong, did you miss me?
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
I thought this was a pub.
Like what?
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
You all right back there, mate?
What are you doing?
It's not him, Dad.
What can I do for you?
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Yeah, one of them's out.
Where?
Invitations.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Tom?
I will.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
I'll see ya.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
You jerk--
I don't know what the big deal is.
--you're going to be on your own.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
That isn't true.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
And what did she do?
Because it's a job?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
You're dismissed, Private.
So you knew this young man before?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
We're not running a dating service here.
Sam the Man.
Skinny?
Nice job.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
So?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
I'm not picking it up.
Best part of the job.
I'm a colonel.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
Same as they done in Mexico.
Didn't have a father?
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
You going to get married?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
Is very beautiful, your car.
Senora Cruz?
This girl has a child?
Your mother was a saint.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
Steve called for you.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Thank you.
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
What about it?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Something wrong?
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Like your story is over.
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
Yeah.
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
You going to tell her?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Hello, L.A.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Nix.
That's Butterfield...
Maybe they're not tricks.
Hokey enough for you?
Who did this?
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Anything?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Are they treating you okay?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Oh Christ.
He taught all this to Swann?
What then?
Is it finished?
What about me?
Where the fuck is he?
And this Butterfield guy--
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Leave her alone --
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Was that Swann's idea?
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
The Puritan?
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh Jeez.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
Can you do it?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Oh, what do you do with that?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Oh, hi.
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Hello?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Oh.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
You made it.
Four.
What happened to your toe?
You think so?
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Ok.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
Will you please stop smoking?
John! What are you doing here?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Uh..thanks.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
What're these?
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
I can take care of myself.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
You'll do it?
You fucking bastard.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
Why are you doing this to me?
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Yes... and you are?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I'll bet.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
What are you looking for exactly?
You okay?
Are you alright?
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Oh, Peter.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
A lot of good that'll do.
You don't want to face it.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Good of you to stop by.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
What do you mean by that?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
That's not funny
Taste this.
What?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
There you go.
That's not it.
Okay.
I can take it.
What?
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Careful.
My mouth is kinda dry.
That was nice.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
It means a lot that you came by.
That too tight?
I found you someone.
And he's fine, girl.
I told him you looked like me.
You do.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
So...does it hurt?
I don't know.  A lot.
You do act different.
What do I have to do?
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
What's that?
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
That's it, give it your best shot.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Guess not.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
What was that about?
I can't be nice to a fan?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Forget Tonya Randall.
That was so weak.
Yo, where's the "D"?
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Who's nobody?
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
We're going to get some food.
Never had to.
What?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
You don't think so?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
You're out of your mind.
What will this prove?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
With who?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
Quincy, please...
Guess I should have been telling your father.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Sorry.
So what are you gonna do?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
And some things should never fucking happen!
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Your teeth are straight.
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
My mother had breast cancer.
...what the fuck is this...?
What do you want? Why are you here?
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
Yes.
No.
You mind if I check things back here?
What are you lookin' for?
Yeah.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
You take cream or sugar?
Yeah.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
No.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
It's my favorite place --
You wanna make a deal with me?
It's fine.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
Well.
Yeah, of course.
It's ok.
You live alone?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Where's the news department at this studio?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
DAD --
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
What?  What does that mean?
That's right.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You mind your own bussines.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
I think you have the wrong number.
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
This isn't meant --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
Why does that sound silly?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
Do you have your masters?
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Is he in pain?
How long...you think?
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
You can't just come in here.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
You're here.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
You look great.
Yeah. Yes.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
How do we do this, then?
No.  No.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
hey.
Two years...three years...
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
I'm Bob.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Are you on drugs right now?
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
Hello.
mmm.hmm.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
I don't have regular classes anymore.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
The fuck is wrong with you?
You coulda been in front --
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
God smiled upon us.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
My Queen...
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
But --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Bloody hell...
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
Where are we?
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
Coming?
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What do we do now?
D'Artagnan, unready?
Die?  What...?
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
I heard your playing.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Raoul is everything to me.
Athos, please...!
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
Recent hours have been a shock.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
Are you hungry?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Where is Michelle?
Continue.
Food, moron.
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
What can I do for you?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Did you hit him?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Yeah?
What?  Wait a minute -
Where is he?!!
Speak of the devil.
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
You must be going somewhere.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
In thirty-five minutes.
How long do I have?
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Why not?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Who did he ask for?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Get me a plane...
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
That's why the boltcutter.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
It does, doesn't it?
Parking permits...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Where the hell's Graham!
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
What's being photographed?
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
What am I doing here?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you see?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Come in.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
In a holding cell.
She'll be in, in the morning...
He's right-handed.
I don't want to do that,
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Hello, hotshot!
Me, too. And very erotic...
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Blue is cold.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
Can you quit?
And... where are things?
What will you do?
Come home with me.
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
That's right.
Lt. Fisk said...
Will it keep them out?
Are you gonna kill him?
You went in the apartment?
Did the girl die?
What kind of coffee do you like?
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I don't believe in God.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
We were just trying to push the envelope --
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
So how can I help you...?
Tony Clifton.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Ten.
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Popcorn?
Go away.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You're NOT DYING!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Hey Andy, good show.
I'm gonna quit.
Give me the book.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
We had a deal!!
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
We'll need a search running.
They are dead.  In either case --
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Do you?
Did you hear that?
Hello, Trinity.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
No, it's all right.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Morpheus...
How?!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
No!  It's too far away.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Do you still want to meet?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
What are you doing?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
Do you know why you didn't make it?
I thought it wasn't real.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
And she knows what?  Everything?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I'm going to make the call.
What's funny?
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
Get this thing out of me!
God...
What did she tell you?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What are you doing?
No, you... have to be.
What?
Can you fly that thing.
Holy shit!
Operator.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Tank, you're hurt.
Know where he is?
What are your plans?
No, all we got is $40.
Well, we want good stuff.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
Look at her.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
You got some mouth!
Nah.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
Don't promise...just deliver.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Hey, shut up.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
Charlie, this is business.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Uncle, how are you feeling?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Hey, where you been?
No.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Come on.
Just keep him quiet.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Dinner?  Again?
Did you speak to the Governor?
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Have you got a minute?
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
Who's Annie?
Oh, the goddam party --
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Paillarde of veal.
Honey --!
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
...See you tomorrow night.
Well... goodnight.
And what would that be?
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Yes.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
No, I don't --
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
No.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
In English, please.
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
And what do I get?
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Well, I guess he's found one.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
Can't, sistah.
My Doctor Lady?
Don' need you okayin'.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
How long you here, Joe?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
You think so?  How do you know?
'Big'?
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
I came to see you.
Very well, I'll watch.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Yes...
Where are you going?
Did you like making love to me?
I like you in a black tie.
'Love will find out the way'?
I believe that, don't you?
I - uh --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
What a good idea.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Bill --
Joe --?
How about giving a guy a break?
I'm not everybody.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Truly - uh - splendid.
And more.
I'm sorry, Bill --
What's okay?
I couldn't sleep.
You are?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
No.
Okay.
Joe, don't do this --
I told you to shut up.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
You are --?
You want me to be your guide --?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
'Yes' what?
I'm sorry --
Yes what?
This one.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
...There's a start for a meeting.
You're terrible.
What is it, Daddy --?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
That was wonderful.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Where is he?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
You said you liked me.
...We know so little about each other.
78.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
30.
You don't know?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
No, let's go.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
What?
Where'd you get it?
You don't remember me.
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Yeah.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Why?
It's isolated.
I wasn't helping you for money.
What?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Who?
What happened?
I'm not.
How?
Don't talk about my wife.
A BEER, please.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
You really want to find this guy?
You're living.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Why are you here?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
So what are you gonna do now?
Happy now?
How'd you know I was in here?
This is a drug deal?!
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
Why would I do that?						    *
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
No.  I was in Namibia...
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
And...?
With Sonny.  110%.
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
Just came in.  She's still alive.
I don't know.
Make it 40%.
We want it back.
How fast does that go?
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Mojitas...?
...and therafore there is no consequence?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
I forgot the napkins.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
José...
You afraid of violence?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
Then it don't work.
How much we looking for?
Where'd you go?
Hello?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Control your men.
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Yeah...?
Yeah.
Oh, good...
C'mon, man!
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Okay...see you soon.
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
And...?
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Equipment?
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
You ain't coming to work?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Where'd that come from?
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
I read it.
Thanks, Joe.
What you got me up here for?
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
The kids? Why are they...
Two kilos.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Want me to take over?
Anybody bitten?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Dad...I'm...
DAD!
Yes.  I think so.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
...are you with the Consulate?
Feeling all right?
And you?
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Get the... midnight... express.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
You got your stuff?
What?
Whose?
Hishradyo.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Billy, what's the matter?
His name?
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
What?
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
The kid...
What do you-?
He's special.
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
Thought it was my week for that.
Honey, just leave it.
Oh, no, you were-
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Don't.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
Talk to me.
No...
You sure you didn't see one of these?
This wing configuration. I've never...
Oh, my!
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
You're very kind...
But what?
No, what is it?
Thank you so much.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
See, isn't this nice?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
What about a bee...?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
Annie, what is it?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Don't talk to me like that.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Stop--stop right here.
Just leave it, all right?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
Yes.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
I thought you were going to dinner.
On what.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
You won.
To win?
Sort it all out.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
- this is very disconerting..
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
Much.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
You don't trust me.
Just like old times?
-- his left jacket pocket.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Very.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
Something else?
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..I'm fine..and you?
Roger that.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
So what did he say?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
Only four more cars.
What kind of show.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Donít Jim.
Did we get it?
I'm walking.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
You were in the car!
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
I didn't say that.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire...Hey...
Whoís dead?
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Kittridge.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Then what am I doing here?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I thought I'd take some now.
Tell you what?
What problem?
How was Chicago?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
I usually am.
You got it.
I knew about Jim.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Whatís the problem.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
Have I been a good wife?
I don't wanna talk about it.
I don't know what you mean.
Here.  Ti amo. 
I'm getting married.
The guy died.
Johnny Cammareri.
In a month.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
I got it done.
What are you doing here?
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
This is good. Uhh...
When you get engaged?
I don't know.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
To the bed.
I was dead.
What about Johnny?
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
You don't get along with anybody!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Why not?
Snap out of it!
What?
Kinda gaudy.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I'm here!
I'm afraid of who I am.
Let me go home.
Let me go home.
He's coming.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Will you marry me?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
What time is it?
What?
WHAT!! She was dying!
What about the moon?
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Don't fight.
My mother's recovered.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
Have you come to make peace with me?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Then why are you eating alone?
Temperature's dropping.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
That's my house.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
You got me.
How do you know she is a witch?
Burn them.
Halt!  Who goes there?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Am I right?
Well, who is your lord?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
Oh!
A what?
Yes ...
Then you shall die.
I move for no man.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Look!
Come Here.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Well, what are you then?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
Nu!
Look, you're a busy man ...
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
Well you could say: "Dennis"
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... but a two-thirds majority ...
What is your name?
What is your quest?
Bring out your dead!
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Who's that then?
Well taken, Concorde!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
Gosh - Is he all right?
Do you want to come and have a drink?
Who are you?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Until you, or anyone else ...
And make sure he doesn't leave.
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
Oh!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
Bravely ran away, away.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Not bad, not bad.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
It's what the maids are for.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Checked and locked, sir.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
I wish to see my mother.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Mother....
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
Do you?
Awaiting my orders.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
For Her Majesty.
You are well?
And the pony?
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Those, over there, there.
They're ready now.
What is it, John?  John?
Must they always follow us?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
Should we take it seriously?
Well, both.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
A fine choice, sir.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Unwell?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Who told them that?
Why not?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
What do they want?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
I have to talk to you.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Where to now?
Where do we go?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
Virgin sacrifices?
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
You're not coming, Alex.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
So how do I start?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
It's been a very strange day.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
What did I say?
It will work out.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
... What??
So, what did they say?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Your Aunt called me.
You're still here?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Yes?
No ..........I.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Okay... but just...just to see.
There's nothing?
Strange to be calling yourself.
"Really?"
"Before I kill you."
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
Rita... I know what you're doing.
To my audition.
What's  the matter now?
You see what I mean...
Yeah, they showed me
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Nice wallets.
The one of 'em still alive?
Palmdale.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
Come on, it works.
What are you doing ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Do you know where you're going ?
What are you DOING here ?
That was eleven years ago.
Yeah a real shame.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Be very, very quiet...
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
An elevator ?
You okay ?
Hand me the 3/8ths.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
You did.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
That was rather.... disappointing.
Zachary.
No. I am not a homosexual.
How long till the drug wears off ?
What was that ?
We can't afford too many surprises.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Thank you very much.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Hello.
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
Not now, Mom.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
What now ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Umm, where do you want this?
This is California, anything is possible.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
THANK YOU.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Yeah.
Totally.
I will. How's Shelly?
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Reason? What reason?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
Thanks.
What're you saying?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
Vada?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Care for a smoke?
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
What's he smoking?
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Well Rose was being very thorough.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
She lives here too?
Lock the door.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
A secret, I like that.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
So what's wrong?
Excuse me?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
They're enormous, I know.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
It would be fantastic.
Shelly?
Did it hurt a lot?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Keep your voice down!
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Excuse me, what about the job?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Home sweet home.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
I haven't danced in.....
Kiss me.
I ahh, better go.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Of course not.
Goodnight Vada.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
When?
Yes..
Hi Vada.
I found this.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Why?
No, no no....
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
What do you get for that?
I paid the money.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
No.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Who's winning?
Maybe black means you're happy?
Did you read ALL these books?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
Daddy??!?!?!
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's okay sweetheart.
Goodnight.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
I knew he wouldn't come.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
No, I'm going home.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Hurry!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Naah, I don't wanna.
Where's your bike?
Do you remember her?
Heaven.
What do you want it for anyway?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
You don't miss much.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
I've lost interest.
You think...
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.

Elmer's Glue?
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Excuse me?
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
And loving him means loving all of this.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
But he always says...
For the twins? What in the world is th...

Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You're not eating.
You never eat when you're despondent.
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Don't you throw up on boat?
Where did we first hear th...

It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...

This is her family and her fault.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
The Big Hurt, huh?
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
I hate that music.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
What do you really want?
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
His Word.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Barbara Jean.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
National television?
Okay.
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
Where are you going?
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
You bet.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Mr. Green?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
You know anything about the stations here?
You must really like him.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
You got a place to stay?
Parts.
I don't know his first name.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Fungus?
Have your children been deaf since birth?
When did you start singing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Do you like him?
Hello.
I'd really like to see you.
Oh.
Oh?
I'm twenty-eight
Premeditated murder.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Yes.
It's me. What is it?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
What National TV...?
We just got a gold record.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Come on.
Why?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
What did you think then?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Looked like an interview to me.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Who isn't?
Say something.
How is it?
Yours.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Describe Mallory.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
I could go for a Coke.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
Yes.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
And they made the first move?
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
The entire wing?
You can't be serious?
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger?
Waitin' in the lounge.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
Rollin'...and speed!
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
They done that too long in my family.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
Yeah.
She done moved to Detroit.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Don't say much, do you?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
How 'you doin' man?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Oh yeah?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
How about another beer?
Hell!
They must work on the section gang.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
That's why you come back, huh?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Goin' to see my kid.
Your boy.
What d'you mean?
What happened, Duff?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Is that so?
My kids want me to teach them.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Day work.
Where' you goin'?
Good-bye, Frankie.
They all got families to support.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
'You Will Anderson?
How about a drink?
I asked you somethin', boy!
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
No. Why?
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Take this off.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
You're hurt...
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
What's this?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Hey, bro.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
What about the route to the core?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Case... are you okay?
I know who you are.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
On a good run... yeah.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
It sounds like you.
Case... Are you alright?
I know.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Shit...
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
What is with this school and prom?
What's that?
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
YOU DID.
You're Pam?
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Who told!
Forget it.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Now this is cute.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
How many times have I fired her?
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Rob's?
You having fun?
Oh.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
That is so--weird that you name your car.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Wow. This must be big.
Josie Grossie.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
I love the way she writes.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Please. Please don't walk away.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Josie, you look Rufus.
Aloha! Welcome!
Yes.
Taste it.
Why not?
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
Uh-huh.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Jesse, help!
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Who told you to choke up that way?
You remember your dreams, Grady?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
I figured you might like some help.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
Here.
What is it?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Who, Jesse?
'Morning.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
So, school going alright?
There's a Jesse on the phone.
Did she always have nightmares?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Horseshit.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
What's happening?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I used to live in this house.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
You're late.
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
I can't believe I just did that.
Then maybe you're ready.
What are we going to do?
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
My God.
Freddy.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
We're here.
That was such a great evening.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
And then I... right.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Coffee?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Here we go.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Are you busy tonight?
Okay -- fine.
Okay.
Whoopsidaisies.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
Hi.  Can I come in?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Eleven.
Cartwright.
Yup.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Well...
I don't know what happened.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
You disappeared.
Well... how have you been?
I thought I'd give it to you.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
That's right.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Yes.
No.  Not true...
No!
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Still loves you though.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
Bernie.
Hello, Bernie.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
Mr. Thacker?
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
So I get the brownie?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Any more announcements?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Maybe.
Yes.
I wouldn't go outside.
Which floor?
Are you sure you...?
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
How was she?
The one down your trousers.
Tell us about it...
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Get up, Billy.
Yes, ma'am...
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Sorry to have bothered you.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
So do I!
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
In there.
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
What?
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Martini!
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Don't you have any clubs?
Let me see your hand!
Gimme a cigarette!
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Hear what?
When?
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Gimme the ball!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Oh, what's that?
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
Time out!
How do ya know that?
Yeah!
Somebody's coming!
Got a cigarette?
A dime.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
Oh yeah...
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Please follow me.
You know, I never got your name.
Who is he?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yeah!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
At this hour?
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
She was your sister.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
Good.
We found each other, didn't we?
Who's dying?
A very large pig.
No.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Why can't you just tell me?
Why are you asking me this?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Why?
Mickey Spillane.
Do you want me to do it?
Hi, Peter.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Hey--
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Yes.  I am.
Is something the matter?
There's no such thing.
What would you call it?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I'll look forward to it.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
You don't have any idea?
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
It's a miracle.
It's still the new year...
Now what do we do?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
I just got a dial tone--
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
You expecting somebody you know?
That was a long time ago.
I never even got to be single.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Kate is that you?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
I came after the woman I love.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Right now?
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
Well, where are they?
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Wow... .
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Terry...?
They're waiting for him to walk in.
What makes him so special?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
The moment I saw you.
What's that?
What?
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
Listen, you like beer?
Want to go out and have one with me?
No thanks... .
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
What are you crying for?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
I'll take it out of their skulls.
My pigeons... .
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
I want to see you, Terry.
Who asked him here?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
D 'n D?
You all right, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
I think you could have.
She's a he. His name is Swifty.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—
I know, Johnny, I know... .
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
The ropes are coming loose.
That sudden?
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
But they are not yet one of us.
...And what is this?
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
Oh, if there is only time!
Live ones where only the dead should be?
No. No! No!
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
What do you suppose for?
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
I said not as a rule.
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
Why not?
You're good.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I don't know where he is.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
Oh, man.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now that's a really big house.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
And she saw you?
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
What?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
I have to qualify, is that it?
Daniel.  Listen --
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
That's all I wanted to know.
Yeah, why?
Quite a mess.
Who was the friend?
Hello?
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
That's funny.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Is that right?
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
How'd you get this number?
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
You really wear that suit.
You were going to see her?
So she did help you?
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
Take your sunglasses off.
Weren't you expecting us?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I know what you're talking about.
The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Have they got Midge up there?
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Take the next exit.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Why's that?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
I can tell.
Flyweight.
You like to sit down?
Thanks, Dad.
Can we change the subject?
What are you thinking about?
He doesn't even look like that.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
He waved to you?
You gonna go get him?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Did you pay the guy the reward?
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
What lizard?
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
Then why are you looking for her?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
We gotta face some facts here.
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
It's tight.
They're all over us!
You hear my okay?
I'm out of ammo!
It's not getting any longer.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Danny...
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
How's everything?
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
What's your name?
How often you fight like this?
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
What if the Japanese did invade?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Hello, Lilla!
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Carol!
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
The only one?
They're waiting. Come on.
Where is it?
All right. What's the scoop?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Peggy Sue!
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Looking good out there.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Charlie, how are you?
I'm sorry Charlie.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
What're you doing here?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
I beg your pardon?
Terry, slow down.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Coffee and a donut.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
I thought I knew everything about him.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
For me?
The hat business is in trouble.
He'll win.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mom!
I'm excused.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Maddy's party.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
I remember that dress.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
Silicon is from sand.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
What do they do up there?
How long ago did this guy retire?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Hey! Where're you off to?
Just out.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
How long have you been here?
Allright. Calm down.
Do you really think so, Andy?
Aren't you giving an exam?
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
It could be parasites, an infection...
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
Jerk... What did you say?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
What's that mean?!
I'm not going to die.
Whatever.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
Thanks for your time.
How did they find out?
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
Get it?
Beckett?
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I've considered that.
We proceed, representing your estate.
I know a good probate lawyer.
A regular all-American guy?
Are you a good lawyer?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Rach.
What kind of movies do they show there?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Yes.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Ms. Burton. You're black.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Were you pleased with his work?
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
You're the asshole, buddy.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Since when?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Now that you mention it...
Yeah. But we took care of him.
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
He was doing a great job.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Oh, Lord....
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Why, what'd you hear?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
What, you're afraid?
Just come with me!
Hey.
Amazing. I'm Johns.
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
He used that?
Well, don't ask me to.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
I don't suppose....
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
And pointless.
SULEIMAN!
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
So much for your nightfall.
Not a star-jumper.
Dr. Zaius --
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
Seal the cave?
The best. But we won't need them.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Well, maybe they're not.
Got your sensors?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Scarecrows?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
One is in a museum!
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Sustained.
What about me?
No.
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Then there is another jungle?
Sure.	In a cage.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
It's humiliating.
Do you believe him?
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Come on you can do better than that!
Where's he from?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Feel good?
...But what'd she do?
But what'd she actually do?
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
You volunteered for this shit man?
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
What's the matter?
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think you're drunk.
Good evening, Miss.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
And do you amuse the guests?
I didn't say anything.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
How did you meet him?
Nice of him.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Us?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
Cold?
If you're doing all this just for me.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
I'm sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
I expected nothing else.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
So you're not a cop.
What's this in favor of?
Thank you.
Where?
It was lying where on the balcony?
How about a cup of coffee?
How are you two getting along?
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
You'd be breaking the law.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
A little something on account perhaps?
What are you doing here?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
You in charge here?
Not too hard, is it?
Was that about the right angle?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
No suicide.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
So far.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
What's this?
How long have you had it?
I told you she's just..
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
Terrific.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
I'll have some of that.
Good.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Oh, but he was terrific.
Me too.
In radio we're different.
In your car
Shall we have a drink or something?
Not here.
Blasé and epicene.
And the Argies.
You approve!
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
That's enough of that.
What have you been up to?
Hold those rights.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
Thanks for stepping in.
Don't you gamble?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gonna pull?
You're a fucking dead man--
Why should I?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Nothing?
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
Nice place.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
What story did you give to Davis?
You're wastin' your time.
I'll see you there.
Thanks.
Any sign of the hostages?
You're looking well, Dutch.
Mmmnnn...?
Where the hell is his body?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Georgia.
Your uncle will like this.
We can reach an understanding on this.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
I... I would take advantage of it.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
That's ridiculous.
Stolen?
So do day jobs.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
For the whole night?
No, but it's getting there.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
It's a very good year.
What do you like?
Did you sleep well?
Where'd you go?
Do you ever... enjoy it?
No?  Why's that?
I buy companies.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Four thousand.
But you want days too.
Three.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
I think you'll approve.
I'm sorry.
You're upset, huh?
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Okay.
What about dinner?
You always been rich?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I've never been on a plane before.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I've never treated you like a whore.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Aw, don't... no...
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Yeah, what?
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Oooh, I love those.
What's your name?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
My Westley will always come for me.
He will come for me.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
You mock my pain!
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
I fear I'll never see you again.
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
We did it.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Why should that make such a difference?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
Hello.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
You've been mostly dead all day.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
No --
-- all that I have and more please --
He's dead. He can't talk.
Slow going?
Sorry.
We'll wait until you're ready.
There's something I ought to tell you.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Then make your choice.
-- get back, witch --
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Bye-bye, boys.
You feeling any better?
Your grandfather's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
What was I saying?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Do you think he'll take the job?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Not.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
Min Bialystock.
You, Blum go Motel.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
I solemnly swear...
By the sacred memory...
Nietzche...
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
No. At least I don't recall.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
Very early. Dawn.
No.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
I live there. Alone.
Now, look...!
Let's all talk about Mary.
Casharoonie!
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Forty thousand dollars.
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
I ought to call the police right now!
Arbogast said...
Stay here.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I can come down next week.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I've caused you some trouble.
You're very... kind.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Thank you, Norman.
You're not going to... to your room already?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
You slept here all night?
No, m'am.
Wait a minute!
Oh?
We have a problem.
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
It isn't necessary.
I'll get your bags.
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Did you wish to see someone?
You mean he doesn't work for you?
He's inherited a fortune.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
How do you do.
Your father?
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
You lie!
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
But it was really my fault.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
I am right! I know I'm right!
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What!
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
That's the one.
What do you mean police dog?
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
That's what I said.
That happens to be the truth.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
Why?
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
Fire insurance!
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
I'd know him anywhere.
A place you've never been.
We flopped the first time out.
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Why?
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
I got an awful toothache.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
What'd you say, Brother?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Yeah.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
This is my place and you can't have it.
He had his hand on her titty.
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
What's happening?
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
What's goin' on?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Are they polar bears, too?
How could that be, son?
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Please do.
Turn up your hearing aid.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now you listen to me, Rose --
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
She hasn't actually done anything...
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Yes, sir.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Well, it was a silly question.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Took your time gettin' here.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
I... I can explain...
I was going to tell him.
You think it's that good?
And... ?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Who cares?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
What'd I say?
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
"A.D."
No offices are gonna be open today.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Dean Martin.
What about him?
What day is it?
Gimmie a butt.
No, we're stealing.
General Jim Beam, then.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
Our resignations.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
What... ?  Not you too?
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Do tell.
The gang's all here!
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
Jabba's palace.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
They are clear, my Master.
The same as always.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
I thought she was with you.
Hey, are you awake?
I...
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Good luck.
What are you telling them?
We're coming!
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Good shot, Red Two.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
There it is!
Oh!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Over there! Two more of them!
Tell me.
Then you know why I have to face him.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
You promise you won't tell?
He might be.  I don't know.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Oh Janet
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Well I want to leave.
Oh Brad.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
You did right.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Want to come again and stay
Feeling
Wheeling
Dealing
Who's Eddie?
...Aren't you skating?
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
...Guess.
Would ya like a glass of water?
Why?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
...And he called the reporters --
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
...Like you?
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Damn.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
This a con?
Few minutes?
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What's ya name again?
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Excuse me.
I'm sure you are.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
...What?
How old?
Did ya win?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
'Bout an hour ago.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Whatta' those?
Really think so?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Whatta you get outta this?
God bless ya, Rock.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
How you holdin' up, kid?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
What's ya sister like to do?
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
I got whiskey here.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
Do you feel you have a chance?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
What's this, Roger?
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Where is he?
How did you get onto Doom?
Hold on a second.
What's with the dip?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Does this help?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
I think you oughta read it to her.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Romeo! Romeo!
A challenge, on my life.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Out--
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Every man betake him to his legs.
'Tis he.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Good marrow, father!
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Pink for flower.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Nurse.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
I don't know.
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Not to me, you know that.
From Interpol?
Lose them!
Do I need to repeat myself?
Hazard pay...
I still am.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Now, what did we steal?
Are you alright?
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
It's quite satifactory.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Where's the case?
We'll double your price.
Do you have the material?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
He's company.
What do you mean?
Here's yours.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
And more importantly --
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
So what do we do?
A means to an end, is that it?
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
I ride with fat-boy...
Is that right?
Cigarette?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Same thing, isn't it?
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
What's going on?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
It was at that.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
I'm going with you.
You sure your friend got the right place?
I never made that claim.
You were behind the door?
Give me a cigarette.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
Do we need anything else?
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
Let's get him out of here...
You son-of-a-bitch...
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
It's the Irish tape we want.
Why didn't you kill her?
Do you have the tape?
Can you get it?
What the hell happened here?
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Ten thousand right here.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We don't know that.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I've got one condition.
I don't know...
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
It's the right thing to do.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
You're out of your mind.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Not bad enough to kill him.
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!
Maybe we should say somethin'.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
Dwayne's dead.
I'm all ears.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Whoa, Earl!
Yeah?  So?
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Hi.
What's wrong?
OK.
OK.  I love you.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
Yeah, I've seen him.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
And what's that?
What?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Anything I can help you with?
Damn it’s hot in here...
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
You'd do this to me?!
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Don't you want it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
You think he skipped town?
Yeah.
This isn't right...
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Wait.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
So tell me what you know.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Where are you going?
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
No.  It was my singing.
I don't want to hear this.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Fine with me.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
What about a little king pao chicken?
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Red Dragon.
Let's go.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
Ricky Tan is alive.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
I could use a little vacation.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
You move well.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Are you okay?
Master Ching taught me.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
And that, of course, would be me.
He was just doing his job.
Beach Boy.
You have one of these?
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
Where were we?
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
You talk too fast.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Excuse me?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
I'm sorry, Lee.
You're killin' me here.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
How much they want?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
What?!
You a cop or something?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
You sonuvabitch.
Hello.
Yes.
I am so sorry about your men.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
Right.
Ahh.
You look awful.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Of course.
"Sink the putt."
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Fisher, let him talk.
Or a vegetarian?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
In vino veritas.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Thanks.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
And you are?
It's nice that they're still friends.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Your two cinnamon rolls.
They made me put my hat back on.
That's fair.
How romantic.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Too much.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
You look... uh... You look fine.
I'll have the same.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
Brian told you that?
Yes I do!
I love you.  I love you.
Yes, you!
Yes, I did.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
I'm going to kill myself.
But I'm weird.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
Maggie, it's just a joke...
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
I'll wait.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
It's delicious, trust me.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
I do.
Walter.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
I told you.  Nothing --
Oh!
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
What?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Men never get this movie.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
What?
It's a sign --
This is a photo of hair.
What are your plans in New York?
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
You know.
Magic.  It was magic.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
It's been about a year and a half.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
You'll see.
You'll like it.
Write her.
Eighty dollars.
Dad --
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Jed's got cables.
Bye bye blackbird.
Great.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Listen to this --
Dad!
Why is she bringing that bag?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Did you call that radio station again?
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
God, she's beautiful.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
What's wrong with Annie?
What if I couldn't get to you?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Do you like baseball?
Hi.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
You saw her in the airport and then here?
You look good.
I thought you were never going to call me.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Is he there?
It takes time --
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Mornin'.
Well?
How goes it?
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
Forget it.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Was it expensive, the beer?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
Tell me.
Where are you going?
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
You know I don't think that.
My kids don't have enough to eat!
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
What can I do for you?
What?
What is it?
Yeah.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Oh God.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
I can't.
You don't understand.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
How much time do you have?
What are you hiding, Danny?
Who is it?
We been through that.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Really, I don't want to.
Who is it?
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
So, why'd you want to see me?
What?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
Danny?
Okay
But...I've seen you.
But... why? Why would you pretend?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Shoot him.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
Cool it. We got business.
I've got a hot one.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
You got a name?
What?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
What? Is it bad?
I thought you'd be happy.
Danny?
Turns out he's connected.
What's that smell?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Nervous?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Really?
You think that's a good idea?
Where's Bubba?
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Report.
But, sir...I...I...
As a matter of fact, I am.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
That must be four thousand yards.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Glad of it.
It looks like a Renoir.
It seemed appropriate.
Over three-hundred.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
The men said, nine.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
What'd you say, Captain?
Caen?
Fresh out.
Uh, Captain...
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
What are we going to do?
Uh, oh.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
I'm listening, sir.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
What deal?
Yes, Private.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Shit, sir.
Who cares?
Demolition, right?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
No, no he's not.
I'll take the whole set.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Look at those eyes.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
C'mon, just do it.
Please?
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
Did you sleep with her?
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
I'll put this past my boss
Visit her at the home.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
They really applauded you today honey.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I won?
Morning honey.
Goodnight.
Morning.
You should be.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
What happened to you?
Honey!
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Busy?
So you're monumentally busy?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
It's just you and your dad, right?
You know what?
Yeah.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
No.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Why didn't you tell me?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
You told your dad?
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
It's your castle, man.
You're freaking out here man.
YEAH!
Jim Court?
The guy with the Datsun?
What?
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
You're not telling me something.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
Where are the guards?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
What do I got for you?
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
What's wrong with it?
Good.  How's it going?
What are you doing?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
It kind of looks that way.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Pots and pans.
Don't ever do that to me again.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Four hundred, four fifty -
We need to talk.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
I didn't do enough.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
How's the name search going?
Have you checked the...
He's broken his pattern.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...
Hang up...call...
Cici. Who's this?
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
Hello? Ted?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
What are you going to do?
I could use some therapy.
I think he's doing Dolly.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Go on, untie him.
Why?
Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
Two.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
You’re the one who got away.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
You broke my heart.
And it's sexier in the dark.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Ssshh! What was that?
Let's go.
Dewey?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Who is this?
What do you want?
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
The young girl is slashed again.
..this week's TKE kegger...
..it's really about family and tradition...
I hate scary movies.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
What are you talking about?
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
What kind of a game?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Nope.
Please, call me Gale.
Are you sure?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
Is that a threat, Detective?
What?
I can see nothing's changed.
Why would the police come to you?
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
Jennifer needs me.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Who's phone?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
No really?
Possibly.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
You're not happy with your part.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
No.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Hello?
No I need to call you. Just you.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
I didn't kill anybody.
How'd you do?
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Dude. What are you doing here?
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
She can't get both of us.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
So...
I wanna let go. I do...
You heard me.
I think you have the wrong number.
So why did you dial it again?
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Uh-huh.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Why do you want to know my name?
What did you say?
I have to go now.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
How do you know his name?
Please don't hurt him.
Don't do this. I can't...
...please... no...
...leave me alone... please...
What door am I at?
Evening, ma'am.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
I like it. It's... sexy.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
I don't know. I guess.
I was first to respond.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
She staying with you?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Jesus...
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
What? What?
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
About thirty seconds.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
I have no idea.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Are you okay?
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Stop. Right there.
So what's his reason?
Which is you...
I thought everything was checked out.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Why are they doing this?
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
No way.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
I thought you dumped her for me.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
How's that?
You don't.  It goes to court now.
What do you think?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Already.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
I don't believe it.
What do you mean?
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
You didn't know.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Here he comes.
Somerset...
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
Who said this was murder?
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Same color and texture.
It's my wife.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
It is Victor.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
How much money do you have?
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
This is a waste of time.
What are you going to say?
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
What are you talking about?
He's preaching.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Did their son see it happen?
But Mose Harper said...
Another one, eh?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
He cometh forth like a...
You got any more orders, Captain?
I didn't give any order to fire!
What in...?
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Yes, sir.
Well, come on!
Say it. We're beat!
Why?
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
Futterman?
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Think she means for us to follow?
Lemme alone...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Stay out here.
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Was your niece about their age?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
She'd be about thirteen now...
Where?
I mean the armchair!
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Do you know where fuse box is?
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
I'll do it myself.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Cherry-red Tears.
Who was that?
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
So, did you sleep good?
Who's that?
Maybe an animal.
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Martin, what-
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
What?
For God's sake, what happened to me?
I really hate to bother him, but...
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Well, look here!
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Oh…what have I done?
Follow that boat!
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
We have no Juliet!
The title?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
I have a wonderful new play!
It's a comedy.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
What happened to Sam?
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Another little problem.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
Kit
Wonderful, wonderful.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
What is the story?
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"But new struck nine."
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
God bless you!
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
As a nurse.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Your Majesty.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
Your Majesty
Your Majesty!
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Master Shakespeare
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Like you, I found him not at home!
Who are you, master?
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
My lady!
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
You can bring them with a word.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Then I will go with you.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
No…no.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
My lady VIOLA.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
Good morning, my lord!
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
"Poet?"
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
All right, just a few questions.
I won't be able to.
I don't know.
Don't you worry about that.
How much?
What is this?
Nothing.
You looking for me?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
I don't know them.
Sorry to waste your time.
Just one thing.
Right.
That's right.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Yes.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- which is --
Know and love?
I think you're lying.
Maybe he didn't like us.
Hugo.
What sort of car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
I wonder how he did it?
Who's going to do it?
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Hello. Hello.
No.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
You know we're right.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
Expecting anyone?
I refuse.
It's about me and David.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Downstairs.
Of course.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Is this where no one stays?
No, I've never seen them.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Eh, I don't know.
What do we do here, David?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
It's nice.
What do you do?
I see.
It was some guy called Brian.
The human condition.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
No. I haven't seen them.
Diseases.
Offering it for debate.
Don't you like her?
Then what's the problem?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That's George.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
Lester.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- is that what this is all about?
I'll be back in a while.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
What about?
Is she all right?
-- Anyway.
No, I know.
You going to answer it?
Like what?
Are you in love with her?
You here to see my mother?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
What?
Right now?
How is she?
Wonderful woman.
You do know what money's like these days.
What sort of references do you have?
You do it.
I don't know. Probably not.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
You would?
And?
George...
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Did you?
Don't do it.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
Where do you want to go?
-- sure.
-- very nice, very nice.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
-- we're kidding ourselves.
Why?
Where are you going?
You're going to kill me.
So I'm saying it...
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
God, there's Lester...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
-- White ladies?
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Here in the canyon.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I just... who what?
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
Now, George --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Yeah.
Honey?
Yeah.
George.
George.
When?
A friend dropped me off.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I know, honey.
Now, Jackie --
Baby, don't do this --
How?
George...
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
It's good you want to do something, George.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
What about Jackie?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
No you won't.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
You and your touchy investors.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Here.
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jackie Shawn.
That's right.
Well, he is.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
I thought you said things were great with George.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- Yesss?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Oh. thank you.
I'm terribly sorry.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
That bastard.
What's wrong?
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
No of course not.
Call me Les.
Dad?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Yes.
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Mom?
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Is Tony one of your animals?
To my stomach.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
What sort of injury did he have?
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
How?
She eh... interferes.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
What'll it be?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
It's good to see you.
No charge?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Hi, babe.
Perfect for a child.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
Did you find anything?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Somebody did that to him.
You mean just leave the hotel?
As soon as possible.
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me,
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me.
Stop it!
I'm Jack Torrance.
five months of peace is just what I want.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Hi.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Can I tell you kids something?
What's the money for?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Went shopping. Why?
There's something else scary.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
What is it?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Was it a prescription?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yeah? Really?
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SPIRIT
SING!
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
His ashes?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
You are so damn sexy.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
What? 
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Look at that.  Get a gander.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Come on, we're late.
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
Three years.  A rookie.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Mary Clarence!
I'm getting experience.
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
What?
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
The reason?
I see.
And all those like you.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
I got it.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
A vote?
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
So I don't shop.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
No nothing.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
I am?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
I have?
I've got to go.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Then one day they find you.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
But you didn't tell me!
Get her!
There she is!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
A sweater.
What's she doing?
It should be here any minute.
We've got to save her!
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
Is this like your old convent?
He's not like other guys.
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
We both missed.
Where?
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Certainly not.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
Stains of blood.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing in sin and lust...
May we look at them now?
Very few, if any.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
The Widow Windsor.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
What is that you wear?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Where are we going?
Out there.  What do you see?
Are you familiar with magnets?
No, I couldn't...
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
What is it?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
All I saw was their lantern.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What was she doing?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
I apologize if I worried you.
What... what are you doing... ?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
I have not been able to face him yet.
Ichabod...
Returning to the Western Woods?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Can you help?
What... what are you doing?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
She has confessed.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Well, what did you want?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
You know what, by God?
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
You like that Vaughan?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What's you last name?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Why'd you live there?
Are you well?
Do you like to play football?
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
What do you mean?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
I know he does.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Yeah.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Yes ma'am.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Well, okay. I got you some.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
Let's just go, Marsha.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Yes.
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
What do you mean?
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Two, right?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
So. Are we ready?
She probably died.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Like what?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
It's for you.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Benefits?
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
Yeah? Who is it?
What are you talking about?
Well, if you put it that way...
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Mostly what.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Here and there. Around.
Yeah, that's right.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Three nights.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Hey, it's you.
Appreciation for what?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Celebrate? What for?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
And started to run.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
None.
I don't know.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
Why?  If they could never take title.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Closer to eight.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
Did you write that column?
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
Greedy.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
Yes.  Initially.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Well, why does it?
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
You think so?
What for, Sheriff?
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
Does it now?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
What else could it be?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Is it possible?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Can I say something, here?
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
No --- how does it go?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
You're right, Joe.
We're not?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Nellie told us about it.
You mean it's a girls' band?
You've flipped your wig!
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
DAPHNE?
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
What are you doing?
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Good night, Daphne.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
You know - the old shell game.
Oh, he does!
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
WHAT?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Jerry - there's another problem.
Like when?
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
Not that, you idiot.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
All right - so what do we do now?
Did you hear that?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
We'll take a rain check.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
And your head is hot.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
How's the bottle?
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
His yacht?
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Josephine -
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
No!
What for?
How did you get that bracelet?
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
About that roadhouse -
You're leading again.
We can have it altered.
I don't care.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Because I got some plans -
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
We got time off for good behavior.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
We understand.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Me?
That so?
Yeah.
Men!
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.
Thank you.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Are you staying at the hotel?
How's the stock market?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
You collect shells?
Josephine.
One of whom?
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Been waiting long?
I seem to be out of gas.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Harmless - how?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
I don't want to bore you.
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
PLEASE!
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
We got different information.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
And who runs it?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
You’d better get going. My parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
Where’s Nick sleeping?
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
I’ll just check into a hotel.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Nothing.
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
What does your gut say?
Six thousand, right?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
You quitting?
What?
Would you grab my shampoo?
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Come on.
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
I should go.
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
What’s he do anyway?
You pawned it.
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I always wondered what happened with us.
What do you say to that?
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
Here it is, right here.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
What about Sounder?
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
And so you did your job, right?
Go on...
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
Can you swim?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
Goodnight, Daddy...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
From Miss Johnson --
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
Come, I'll take you home.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Whatcha wanta order?
Hi ya, Rebecca...
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
Good mornin', Nathan.
How's the weather out there?
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
What did he want?
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
But, Nathan--
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Dude!
Is it Cartman's mom?
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
You're late, Cartman!
Cartman?!
CARTMAN!
Mph rmpmh rm.
Mph rm rmph!!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Mkay.
What?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
That's gonna take a long time!
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Nowhere.
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Shiteater-
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
What about air strikes?
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
AGH!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
You know I do.
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Hi Wendy.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Check.
Getting drunk is no solution.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Oh yeah...
So...
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Weren't you down in the dining room?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
What did you say to me?
So, are you on for the next one?
You gotta think of your old age.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
It's time we lock coordinates.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Everyone just stay put.
Are you ready?
Do you want some advice?
What's that?
And what are you going to do?!
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Dawn.  Come in.
Sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
What is it?!
I'm fine.
Thank you.
What is happening around here!!!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
You have orange whips?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Hey, you still here?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Sure, Sid.
How do you turn this thing off?
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
I do what I gotta do to survive.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
We ain't married no more.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
Son?
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Don't tell me, John.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Who's there!
What did you do to Buzz?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Uh...over easy.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Business.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
He's dead Sheila.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Lips still for sale?
Some unfinished business.
There's heat coming the door.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
They told me about sixty hours.
Nobody move.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Where is it?
Don't do it!
Thank you, Colonel.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
Edmunds?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Can you open that panel?
It's not sucking, sir.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
What?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
How can he be missing?
Edmunds?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
You're next, Norman.
We have a library?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
In Edmunds' things.
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Don't tell me to calm down!
What's the matter?
Still clear?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
None of this was here before.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Ulcers.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You ever given an injection before.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
How do you feel about snakes?
You know what I mean.
He can't manifest.
You're insane.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
Beth, stop it!
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Would it work?
What are you looking for?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Just in time, too.
You're staring at me.
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
Don't be defensive.
You sound defensive.
Our answer.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
I don't follow you.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
... you there?  Norman?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
Fine.
We're never gonna make it.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Her legs are in the way.
How's that working out, by the way?
What does Norman already know?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
You've heard of me?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
You want me to try?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
Squint harder.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
No, not anymore.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Are you all right?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
I can't see!  How can I fight?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
What about the princess?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
I found it... It's just not there.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
This isn't going to work.
I think she's going to be all right.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Please continue, Sergeant.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Johnny, this is Zander.
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Well, whad'ya know...
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
Carmen...?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Good for you.
She's flying starships !
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
I love you, Carmen.
You talk to Carl ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
What's wrong with you ?
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Where'd it come from ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
What ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
What ?
Well, see ya.
You used to dance...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
Good good, then it's all settled.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
What do you think you're doing ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Let's go.
Don't be a hero...
Mister Rasczak ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Where is Lt. Ilia?
They have repressed the Creator.
Our data is being prepared.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
Programming ready?
Granted.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Why aren't you on board?
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Evening, Annie.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
I quit the movie.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
I...
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
...such a pleasant sound.
About <u>conflict</u>...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Later on.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Yes.
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
That's right...
Hi.
Where you going?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Press still works.
That's something a man could do...?
...and we could get up every morning...
What are you going to do?
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
I've been thinking.
I have to tell you something...
I wasn't doing business.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
What courthouse?
Well, where do they hold court?
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
Fourteen year old girls.
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
Are you Okay?
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Aren't you ever in school?
Izzat so?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
I love Jewish men.
...we had a script conference...
Claire, when did you...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
You can't do what?
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
And you know what...?
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...yes...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
You show Claire these sketches?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Why not?
Why?
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I'm looking for the writer.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I...
I...?
We're out of money.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I want to make a good film.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
What's the...
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
No, what is it?
Then you're finished in show business.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
<u>Stop</u>...
Marty...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
Pay her off.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
I want them thrown in jail.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
She coulda done better than him.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Zat true?
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
I'd rather be with Mommy.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
How would you know sh...
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I can't hear you.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
I could help with the debate.
I don't want to say goodbye.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
No.  I think it's ugly.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
No they're not.
...your hating me.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Rachel's job is she works.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
I'm fine, ba...
Find the bird cage?
And when did that pass?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
Something's up wi...
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
Me too.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
We...
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
So why did y...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
You WHAT?
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Did I hear the word...
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
You bet you are.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
She hasn't mentioned this.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Looks nice enough to m...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
You're lying.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
Look.  I know they hate me.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
They're my kids.
No problem.
I needed some time away.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Consuelo?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Speak English.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Who is Jesus?
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
How did they execute him?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
But still, you can't be sure.
But really, you never know.
Twinkeys!
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
We used pull.
What are you going to do?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Ready for tomorrow?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
What do you want?
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
So? How was school today?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Hey, Mikey!
You have beautiful skin.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Great!
But...you called.
That's too bad.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Huh. Kids?
Is it loaded?
Can I see what you have so far?
What is most important to you?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Forget about it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Cooper...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
Come on, drink up.
What about Cooper--where is he?
So, what are we looking at White?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Good.
Are we adrift--
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Possibly some coffee?
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Yes?
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
General Schmuck?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Suppose that were the case?
How much soda, sir.
That about right?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I don't think so, sir.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
And you'd like to see that?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Have you tried the recall again?
What's the target.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Then this is it.
No, this looks like the real thing.
So am I.
Where'd they get you?
Shoot, Lothar.
What's your point, Lothar?
Second safety.
How do you know he's dead?
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
That's the point.
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
Have you tried the emergency system?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Forget it.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Responsibility, progress.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Sounds like a bummer.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Stuck with what guy?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
No, no.
A long, long, long, long, while.
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
No. Life is too short.
Sure.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Wait. Hey, man.
She's dead?
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Am I fucking him?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Buff.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Score! Yeah!
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Whoa!
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You could do it.
You okay, man? You okay?
Will you stand up for me?
Come on. Inside.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
I'd like to.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Mm.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Why? Because I give a shit?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
This is my home.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Please?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Yes, I stand for -
This is ridiculous!
It was a racial incident.
Okay, what would you have done.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Come on.
Wait, away?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Yeah.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Great.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Yeah?
You do not!
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
No, I'm going.
What's that supposed to mean?
Me?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Yeah?
Just one?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
I'm going out later.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Hello?
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Positive.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
I sure do.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Jack, I think I should get a job.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
Shut up.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Yeah?
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Hannah, we've...
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Is that you down there?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
All of you!
They could kill you.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
My best friend got pregnant.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
What the hell do you want?
Roll 'em.
Good party.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
This is Miss Kramer.
If I could be of any help...
I've been hoping to run into you.
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
With a wildly beating heart.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
You sure have.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
So do I.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Who's Norma?
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
May I say you smell real special.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
You bet.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
Her own movie theatre.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
We've missed you too, dear.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
What month?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
You'll like it here.
How about some evening clothes?
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Don't bend back like that.
You think this is all very funny.
What's the matter with you?
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
Did she read the script?
Have one of mine.
How did it go?
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
That's a lie!  They still want me!
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
You heard him.  I'm a star!
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
This room has not been used for a long time.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Is that so!
Uh-huh?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
How is she?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
What's the matter, Max?
You made her a star?
And she's turned you into a servant.
We've come for the car.
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
How's that about your being my friend?
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Paramount is calling.
What is the scene? Where am I?
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
What does it mean?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
Home?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Maybe it was just an accident.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Let's talk about us, not her.
Away. From you.
That makes it worse.
But what if---it wasn't real?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
Hey! Ethan!
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I bet they do.
What is it?
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
I know it.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Can I give you a lift?
Someone's chasing him.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Superman will return it.
What are you making:
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
What can I do for you?
Balefire on you, Selena!
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
What is this place?
Others?
It's lovely. . .
There is a way.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Goodbye...
What are you talkin' about?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You look wonderful.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
You know what's the problem?
I just can't stand this.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Me??
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
He really was!
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Name?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
How do you do that?
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
A computer.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Stone mutha.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Can you do that?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Who is she?
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
I thought you'd never get here.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
"At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining." ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
I can't see anything.
Okay? Goodbye.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
85,000 dollars.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Small potatoes.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
He's the only one who can operate this --
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Anybody been hurt?
I do?
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
I didn't think I wanted to.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Let's go to my place.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
But . . ..that's terrible!
Gee. But --
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
He has powers as we do . . .
You must be freezing.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Who is this . . . Superman?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Yes, but will you honor it?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
They make my eyes itch.
You're late. Very late.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Any more like you back home, Clark?
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
No Paris?
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
I think he's kind of cute.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
But he's never there.
Where's Clark?
Whoa. . .
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
What I need this for?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Destroy Superman!
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mom...
Do you know where you're headed?
Your bookie?
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
What now, my love?
Big night coming up?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Listen...thank you.
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Again???
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Nuts. He made it.
Krypton!
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
Meteorites!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
You're happy, aren't you?
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
You got wax in your ears?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
Lara, please...
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I guess I got carried away
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Lois, the kickback story...
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Well...flashlight?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Can you really see through anything?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Do you like pink?
I...uh...
What's the matter, Otis?
I broke the man out of prison --
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Sort of.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Luthor  --
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Ally Jones.
Yes...fine.
So there were others?
My name is...
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
So what brings you out tonight?
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
What time's he coming home?
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
What do you mean?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
You want a cup of tea or something?
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
No.
That's right.
Dolores.
That's the local bar?
Need a hand?
Yes.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
We do.
Yes.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
So you're just the thing we need.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
Yes.
You are?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Do you like the colour?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Are you sleeping?
What do you mean?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Will the police do anything to her?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
But of course...
He's somewhere...
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Not being partial, are you?
Why are you trembling, dear...?
Sidney is a liar!
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Match me, Sidney...
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
How?
He means that much to you...?
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
What would you think of me if -
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
What's the matter?
Why me...?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
We stick in each others craw.
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
J.J., if you think -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Please... let... the kids... go...
Do you know about the chip?
No good.
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
What does that mean?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Everything.
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Excellent.
Not even of dying?
This is tactically dangerous.
I'll deal with the police.
Will it melt in there?
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Easy money!
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Mom?  You okay?
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
They took him from me.
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
The CPU from the first terminator.
Is it safe for them here?
Are you afraid?
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
I guess so, sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
What's that mean?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
You bet.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You live here, in Berlin?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Think you can get me any of that?
Of course.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
Did you call someone you knew?
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
What telegram?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Yes, I know who he is.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I have illegitimate children.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
How can I know such a thing?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
I've remembered something else...
And ask him about his private life.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
And you're from the future too?
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
Good field-dressing.
Kyle?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Not possible.
A girl.  You know.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
Surrounded by living tissue.
I can help you...
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
Are you finished?
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Clean out your locker.
I'm so sorry.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
What's with him?
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
There's got to be a flashlight.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
I'll give you a boost.
Please...
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
There goes a thousand dollars.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
Nice.
Where'd you get this?
Okay.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
They're watching.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
Where'd you get that... ?
What the fuck are you... ?
It's mine...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
I didn't know what else to call you.
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Originally, Connecticut.
One brother, one sister.
You need anything?
Trust me.  Call that number.
It doesn't matter...
Do it for YOU.
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Really?
Split it?
I'll explain someday.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Physical?
Guess!
I need the police.
Hm?
Dinner's in the oven.
You did?  How is he?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Hey... !
Just what I told you.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
I only saw Theo drive up.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Well, this lot is full!
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Nell --
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
All the carvings.
Nell!  What's wrong?
All right...
I don't know.
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Come on.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
This is where we're going?
What happened?
When do we take the tests?
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Is there something about the house?
Why?
What did it cost?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
I've never had a pedicure before.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Are you sure?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
We think someone is here.
No.
How they goin', kid?
What.
What kind?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Who done it, then?
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Has he?
Too easy?
Do you have any friends, man?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
What d'you say, Elaine?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
I might've been away for the weekend.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
I bet.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Tell us about it.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
I don't believe it.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Yeah, I guess you are.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
It was you.  Downtown.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
You do?
Like what.
What's in it?
I miss my kids.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Rachel.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
But more or less.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
...I wanted to make you happy.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
...Mm.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
...Was that a pass?
...You bring a check?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
...That's quite a wife you got there.
How much to they want, Dave?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
...Dave?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
Rye.
Honey.
I don't know what's going on. I--
Should I... should I tell you why?
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
Will anyone else say they knew?
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
...So, uh, who should I--
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
...Huh?
...Ed?
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
This hair.
...You ever wonder about it?
Mr...?
...You're Ed Crane?
Doesn't bother me.
Yes, sir.
He's a barber.
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
Forget it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Lieutenant --
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
How big is the sub-basement?
What does it say?
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
Come back and get me.
How many storage areas are there?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Where is that?
What's that?
We're not supposed to go back there.
Quiet!
Argo!  Hobbes!
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
Where would we find it?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
That's not what I saw.
What was it?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
Wounded?
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Is there another way around?
What happened?
For what?
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
Where exactly?
Viti Levu.  For how many?
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Welcome.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
I have a map.
Why not?
Sure she would.
No...I, er.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Every time you and Marlon--
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
What do I do?
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
They're coming.  Any minute.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Poopy day?
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
Have you examined them?
And what's that?
He just let it explode.
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
You know my work?
What killed those men?
Negotiating with whom?
How can I reach you?
You found something?
That would be my guess.
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
No. I haven't.
Scully?
I wake you?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What did you find?
How was it contracted?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
This virus -- it... 
It may be extraterrestrial.
You hear that?
Scully....?
Where'd they go?
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Scully --
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Did we go sailing?
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He hates me.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Don't bring it home in this.
Sing a song of sixpence.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
Is it cold in here?
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
Agent Novak?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
What happened?
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Where the hell are we?
Well look at that.
Who says?
Oh no... No you don't.
Agent Cole.
Already there.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
Instead of going into his mind...
Into Stargher.  Inside...
So?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
You were awfully good.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
His own doctor?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
Can I hear you?
When...what did you do?
Oh, that was many years ago.
...and buried him.
Seemed like a good idea.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I wish I knew.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
I'm going back home.
...you know.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
...Headquarters.
...quarrel?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Do you know this man?
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
Where?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Him dying like that.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Get the next plane.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
...in the morning.
This is where he vanished.
I suppose you don't believe me.
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Very good, sir.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Do you expect me to give myself up?
You told them, didn't you?
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...this way.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
...were of you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Coffin?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
Harry...
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Should I make it all fact?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Everyone ok?
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
She is gone!
Hi.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Fucking Danny, man...
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What do you think you're doing?
What, do you like it here?
How come you know all this shit?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
You will.
Why no silencer?
What's he care about?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
When can I see you?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
What's it about?
And belief follows?
No, I think you shouldn't.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
No. What are you looking for?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
You wouldn't announce it?
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
And Jewish men like to get it.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
I don't think you know what you are.
Who killed Manzetti?
I thought you hated Torah.
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
It was a nine millimeter.
How did you get the fucking number?
Don't tell me what I --
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Which one were you aiming at?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
That's all we've got left.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
How did you know they were Jews?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
It's Friday....
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
Are you going to keep it?
No!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Good afternoon.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
And just where are you from?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
He can learn.  He is learning.
How do you know that?
Is he alright?  What happened?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
And... does the voice come back?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Well, what are they?
Why?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Two years younger than you.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Here...  Here...
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I'm concentrating.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
Don't you have a heater?
Tea... or whiskey?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
In the lake?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I'd better get back now.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques, you set a world record.
Hello?
How are you?
I'm being a pain, huh?
You sure?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
So why the long face?
Please. Will you help me?
There won't be any need for that sir.
So, now what?
Mordechai?
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Esther!
You two know each other?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Okay, what's the information?
But we're not open on Sundays.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
What's wrong with him?
How do we bypass it?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
Mmm———yes.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Sure.
What's left of him.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head —- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ——
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
Some crazy guy.
To the eye? Like other men.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Wait ——
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
On his back, I suppose.
No —- not yet.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
What else do you care about, Kicks?
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Can it be that easy?
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Are we understood?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Mr Lombard?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
Is there anything to understand?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
So you did talk about it, huh?
What do you suggest?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
The word for those things is croissants.
You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
By your Austrian?
You don’t know why he’s come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
What’s the Ambassador?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
What if it is?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
The £1,000 is on account.
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Problems?
Clients come and go.
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
Is it real?  You people are sick.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I don’t.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
It’s about the puppy. You got the money?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Fine...
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Le montage, l’emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors’ stuff. How much would it cost me?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
You’re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what’s left of him...
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne, stop it!
Good.
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
I'll go.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
What did the king say?
To be killed in battle?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I'm already free...
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
Jeanne's alive!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
Go onto the next question.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
I can't read.
Do you have a sword?
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
And?
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Dead you're worthless, darling.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
Were you baptized?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
Supposing she's an assassin?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Well...?  Shall we go?
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Clear?
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Why were you yelling like that?!
My... visions...
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
They won't come anyway.
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
Yes...
My father's.
Then... why are you here so often?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
How long have you been married?
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Funny time to say this.
Can you help us?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Boys, boys...
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
A good place for what?  He's insane!
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
Careful! Watch his hand.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
She looks tired.
Yes, why not.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
You don't want to learn.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, words. You have never heard words?
Wash them again.
Everyone has to practice.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
What did she say?
Which way are the rooms?
Yeh, go ahead.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
Then why ain't he dead?
Wasn't no problem a mine.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
Mottola.
They're still looking for him.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
No signs of trouble?
How 'bout Lonnegan?
And?
No.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
You beat him, kid.
You wanta wait for your share?
You in?
Raise 300.
I guess I left it in my room.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
She coulda killed me last night.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
You done?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
You're dreamin', kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
You weren't hired to miss him.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
What is this?  I got work to do.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Cheer up, darling.
Well!
No.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
Then what are you hiding?
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
There. 
She fell down.
I don't know.
This is my wedding.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
I know -- I know --
Yes.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
You've been there?
He's holding out on you.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
He telephoned me today.
About three.
I didn't know they had a fight.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Chris!
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I see.  I see.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Where's Gilbert?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
You did... where?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
Perfectly absurd.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
What's that?
Why do you say that?
What am I?  The fall guy?
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
What hit me?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
No thanks.
I'd like to see you work.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Hello... send him up.
Aren't you hot in that?
Did I give it to you?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
What things made you so sure?
Is that true?
Why are you saying it?
How did you get in here?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
I'm sorry...  but...
I just wanted to tell you...
Where were you going?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
What kind of mine?
There's nothing we can do.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Missile!
You ready?
What about it?
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
You're out of your mind.
It's a combat action.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
So you can give us away?
At-at-at-at-at.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
You think?
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
What do we do with the Humvee?
What?
You didn't step on any mine.
It's a mine, isn't it?
Where you going?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
This.  Whatever it is.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're doing more than slapping.
Why do I have to stay down here?
What the hell took so long.
We should head Northeast.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
First Wes, now you?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Epps?
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
What do you figure it is?
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Well?
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
What did you say?
Oh, God...
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
An Iraqi?
What do you make of them?
Can you ride a horse?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
People are suffering.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
Jaeger?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
You ever think about dying?
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Yeah!  Yeah!
We have to go back.
What the hell are you doing!?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
Stress category.
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Hurry up.
Control ON.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
When?
I've never been under the table before.
Look, food!
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
Are you all right?
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
Good Lord!
I thought you were through with it!
What's going on....what are you doing?
What?
Who?  Who's leaving?
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
What?
...and you're not lost now?
What was that....
I knew him.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Just do it.
Where did you get this?
Alright, let's check it out.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
Only once, at Redstone.
This is where the van was parked.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
How long were you hooked?
I terrible with mechanical things.
What's up?
How do you know?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Fuck factor?
Keep talking.
Any word?
Bev, you're the greatest...
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Computer device?
Alright!
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
You okay?
Drop it.
What the hell was that?
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
Prints?
What about the ballistics report?
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Pooch, can you move it?
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Nice to be here.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
<u>Niente!</u>
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Like it?
I want to see-- 
And as for you, waiter--
I hope you find the figures correct.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
But not now.
You say I am a crook.
Thank you, Major. 
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
I like you, Baron.
Monescu!
Right.
They're all right, aren't they?
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
But, Lily--
And you--
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
That's too dark.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Do you know my first name?
Make it out to cash!
Eighteenth century.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
I'll be delighted.
Yes, madame?
Then lunch in the Bois--
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
And you're going to fall for them.
Any minute I want!
But attractive--
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Thirty-three--
It could have been marvelous ...
No, m'sieu!
Two lumps, madame?
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Then why did you do it?
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
How much time?
You're certain?
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Rush her.
The partners want to know how it's going?
You know I don't like that, Rose.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
An accident?!
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
My God... Cal. Is it a --
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Something serious has happened.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
How you two doin'?
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No you won't.
You're distracting me. Go away.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
So don't marry him.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
Where to, Miss?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
It's bad.
Will this work?
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Yes sir.
April 14, 1912.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
Hope we're not intruding.
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Feeling a little better, I see.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
Will you pardon me?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
There's soft music--
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Married?
Sooner it you like.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I could see you were pining away--
How well do you know her?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
We coulda got two third-class!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Nix, the law!
This is a business trip!
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Three Jacks.
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
I thought you were a sucker--
How about you?
I'll go with you.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Yes--Me--in person!
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
--And he has sex appeal.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
--you'd go with him!
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
There you are, sir.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I'm all right.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Where'd you get that horse?
Come on, you...
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
That's just my game.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Here, Doc.
You don't even know him.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
You really look awful.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
You feel bad about this?  About me?
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Oh, all right.
Really?  You sure?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
It's that woman from the coach!
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
That a fact?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
How did you get this number?
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
What - no lust for adventure?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Wait a minute -
Do you feel better now?
What about the uranium?
His newspapers?
Gone fishing.
That's reassuring.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Natalya?
She married a hockey player.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Married?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Nice to run into you again.
This has got to be a mistake.
Not a lot of difference.
Down?
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Who's in charge here?
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
No.
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Damn. It's doing it again.
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
How sweet.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
What the hell is going on?
Please sir. Please -
What about ID's?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
You're always taking his side.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
How is the garden doing?
What, are you having another party?
Since this morning.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Good morning.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
What's the problem here?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Those boys never did have good luck.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Where is Skip?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Which one can I open first?
We're almost there.
Hello-o-o...
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Yes, I can.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
What's going on?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
THAT is Sid!
I could have stopped him.
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Spaceship.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Well, thanks for the ride.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
ROOAAAARR!!!
They're getting bigger.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Reach for the sky!!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Hey, Slinky?
I'm red this time.
Woody?!
I want to go home.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
I think she's lying.
Should we bring the police into this?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Did you tell Dad?
Are you going to?
What's up?
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Live with your parents?
You do?  What else you do?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
That's a big word for a fisherman.
What do we do?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
You may speak.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
That's good coke.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
A group of us are going out tonight.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
You should feel good about this.
One question.  How did you find about this?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
My work keeps me young.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
What?
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Hello.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
Well, why didn't you bring them?
I'll be right after you.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
For fuck's sake.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Where are you going, Diane?
Where's that?
Holding hands?
Can I see you again?
No.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Thanks, Mark.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Director?
The park?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Say something, Mark, say something --
You know.
It was my fucking television.
That's tough.
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
That's hardly a substitute.
Great.
This had better be good.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
It's the great outdoors.
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
What do you see as your main strengths?
The ship....
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
This is the Starship Enterprise.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Can we have it quiet?
Bob?
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
What is it you seek?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Jim.
I could use a shower.
Not General Korrd.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
There, you see? See?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
I am here, Captain.
It would appear we are too heavy.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
No special conditions?


And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Spock?
Why not?
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Did you say Group 7 access?
What for?
Flynn!
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
This town's full o' live ones.
Yes!
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Who is your User, program?
Alan!
Well, isn't it -- ?
Flynn!!
Did we make it?
Feel what? You okay?
What's goin' on?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Thank. you, Master Control.
A User?
But-what if I can't...?
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
What do you think?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Yori... hey...
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
You've grown, big program.
We have to get off this beam!
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Can you cover me for an hour?
That's not true, honey--
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
How was school today?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Dad, how come you know the words?
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Son of a bitch!
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
There's another guy, still in the car.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
He's got it.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Yes.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
They said you had to run out.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
What?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
I think so.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
What did he give you?
It makes you tell the truth?
No.  But I wanted to.
As much as you used to?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Boris and Doris?
Who's your little friend?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
That was you?!
Were they trying to kill you?					*
What's happened?
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Let me speak to Clarence.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
I didn't get any chicken.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Tell him to look through it.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
I love to get pie after a movie.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Burt Reynolds.
What kinda music do you like?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
I love Janis.
She OD'd, didn't she?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
You have a pimp?
What did he do to Arlene?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
I think what you did...
With a vengeance, I hated them.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
What?
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Wannabee nigger...
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
I'm a married man.
What?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
This is Drexl's coke?
Elliot what?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
In case of what?
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
He wants to talk ya.
Say it, goddamn it!
No. Not yet.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Wanna count your money?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
What makes you think I would do that?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
You and Robin moved?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
Could we try it now?
Or a bit player -
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
You do more than try.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Sorta room-mates?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
That's him.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Do you know why you're here, James.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
You're afraid of germs?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
It's just a shot to calm you.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
"Never cry wolf!"
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
We need gas.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
I don't understand what we're doing.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Germs?!
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
Jo...Jose????
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
What...virus?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Nine thirty
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
You afraid of the dark?
You don't fear death?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
It's nonsense.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Will he be back soon?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
How much time?
Accident.
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
How much?
How much!?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Two-hundred.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Nice place you got here.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
What do you do anyway?
A medicine man?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
All right, Grace.  No more games.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
You love him?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
I shot him.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Well, nothing.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I'm a solid man.
Live there?
Why would I kill her?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
That's a bit much.
What should I do?
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
No.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
I asked you a question.
I want to stay.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You're fucked.
Mister!
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Maybe I do.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
More or less.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
Talk?  About what?
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
But he's dead.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Hey.
Hundred-fifty.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
What you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Where you coming from?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Are there snakes out here?
I'm guessing no.
I don't know how.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I wanted to talk.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
The money's right here! Get the key!
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
What'd you say to me!
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Morning Grace.
Anybody hurt?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
I want to stay.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Once again please?
How old is Jeb?
What about Jeb?
When was the last time I wore pink?
I remember you.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
I assumed because of the train.
Just give me a minute.
Quick.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to work out.
No Jeremy.
How much did you take off?
You like sports?
How are you feeling?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
Is this a religious thing?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Yeah, I guess.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Hit your finger, huh?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
What's all that wood?
They really got all that money, them whores?
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
But... if he doesn't miss?
Who killed him?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A sign on him?
Then... what?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
He said that, huh?
What for?
Jesus!
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
You're goin' back with him?
Shit!
Better re-load it.
He's in there.
Yup.
Say, Bill...
I trust you, Bill.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
She gave me the evil eye.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
That fella come by... Tom.
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Jesus.  You done this before?
His pistol must of jammed.
That ain't what I mean.
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Keyser Soze
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
I know who he is.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
This is not right.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Why don't you just calm down'
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
What the hell do you want?
Don't hurt me.
You have to come.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
I'11 be alright.
Fenster and Hockney?
We'll make it.
What is it Keaton?
You set up the line-up.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
No, no, no, no, no.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Came from Redfoot.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Then what?
What call?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
What did he find?
... tell me about this case.
What is the truth?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
... he wants to testify ...?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Say it.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Well, many reasons, actually...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
How old are you?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Just now...
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
That's not my handwriting.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
And you wrote that...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
) I'm sorry ...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected ...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
Then why don't you testify?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Are you done?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Why?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
Maybe I can do something right.
What happened...?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What are you going to do?
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
...I have to stand up for her...
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
What happened, Joey...?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...yeah...good...
What the hell are you doing here?
Yes.  Yes, I have.
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
What?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
A single hour.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Would you like a drink now?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
How can I see her, to know her?
Ernie's.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Hello.
Just let me talk to you.
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Mmm.
Tomorrow night? Well --
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I like that one.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
You don't even want to touch me.
Ernie's?
Come here.
Can't you see?
We're going awfully far.
Scottie, why are we here?
But why? Why here?
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Love me... keep me safe...
Where were you?
When?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Do you know where you're going?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Do you hear anything?
No, I can't tell you!
What do you remember?
Where?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
Why?
Where?
Let me go! Let me go!!
Oh, yes!
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
How do you know? Personal experience?
I had to quit, Midge.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
My... the acrophobia.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Is she pretty?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
What have you been doing?
She died.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
The stripper's here.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
Can't do what?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
What did you say?
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
More.
I'm calling the police.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
We can't do this.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
Real times.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
If anything ever happens to me...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
That's right.
Is everything okay?
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
Call 911.
Nobody knows she's here.
What kind of words?
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's cracked up.
I said, what have we done?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Whatever you say Kojak.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
The hell I did!
Nope.
I don't hate women.
Not true.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Why?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
Are we going to do this again?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
You expect more what?
Time out.
How much?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Do you love me?
Take care of those chairs.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Yeah. Nesting.
Where are you?
What about the chairs?
What okay?
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
Don't even.
What are you talking about?
You fucked a prostitute?
Call the police.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
No...
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
That's a good one.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
We will.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
She's dead.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Was that difficult to get?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
You must think I am a monster.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
You must think I'm mad.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
You believe me, don't you?
What will the lady say?
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
What's the matter with you?
So, Ramona!
What are you thinking about?
You see how much you like her?
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
Yes -- very, very big!
He came in through the cupboard.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
What about you, Manuel?
Have I slept long?
What?
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
I should have told him.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
What did you find out?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
HEY!!!
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
John died.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Go to hell.
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
What does that mean?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
How did you find out about the toxin?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
You okay?
Where's John?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
No, this is great.
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...

You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
We're going to have to explain away the...
What crisis?
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
...the... 
...but...
...they sound what?
<u>Who</u>?
Yes.
Precisely.
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
You're tired, Ronnie.
...this is magnificent.
What are we going to do?
Oh, God...
Give'em another pill...
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
Oh, MiGod.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
We're locked into Albania.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that? 
...Yes.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Do I know you?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
...who is this guy...?
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
W...what?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
What?
Mmm.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
The Albanian Campaign.
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.

He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
An anti-psychotic...
Mmm.
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
No, I didn't think so.
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?

Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
... That's what you told us to say.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Speak English will ya.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
What brings you out here...
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
You sure?
I don't know anything!
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
So what's the problem?
How do you know?
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Where is it?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I don't.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
Hi.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
You told him about us?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
He did?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Hello?
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Can this be stopped?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
I know that.
Of course you will.
That was very good.
Are you mad at me?
I miss you.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
These are good.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
You think that'll help?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Toward the end.  You remember?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
You're the flower lady.
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
What?  What are you afraid of?
Tell me.  Please.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
You must think I'm pathetic.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
What was her major?
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
Well good.  So you're human.
What is it?
You think he killed her?
Seance.
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Sit down here.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Mef?  What's Mef?
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Does Norman know?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
I'm a terrible friend.
I can't believe this is happening.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Jody he was lying.
When's she out of here?
If you have to work...
It's okay if you're not.
It's just us now.
Did she say that?
Remember how we were?
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
What are you doing here?
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
I think so.  Maybe.
Sorry.  You understand.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
When?
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
I don't need a shrink.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
I never said...
How do you know this?
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
You know I am.
You dropped a glass.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
The...
...I'm positive this time...
It's Madison Fra--
I never asked you to quit!
We have to get out of here.
What?
I'm cooking you dinner.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
Rowan...
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
I don't want the -
Eighty million doll --- ?
STOP!
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
You're very clever, aren't you...?
Only you...
I do not understand...
Oh god...
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
Yessss...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
What do you see...?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
You sure...?
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Is he - is he gonna die...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
So there is only one key...
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
How long have you been watching me?
And how did it feel to be rid of him
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
What's wrong?
Yes...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
Well, what do you think?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
What's wrong with you?
Is LESLIE here?
It's been what, three years?
Just put it in my room
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Sugar?
ANGEL...
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
Get them together.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
What gives, Don Corleone?
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
You're way ahead of me again?
Whatever helps you cope.
Finally, some gratitude.
Sorry I--
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Who exactly ARE you?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Are they okay?
I miss them, too.
You're a peach.
That's a crappy thing to say.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
In what sense?
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Me?
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
Wow...you clean up nice.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
He's on the move?
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Do you trust me, Julie?
I want you to trust me.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I never figured you for a pimp.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
I'm warning you.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
I do?
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
How quaint.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Talk to me Artie.
You look pretty.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Try, Kelly.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
You saw the news today?
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Eliminate the competition.
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
About a year ago.
No.
Why?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
Thank you, Jimmy.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
So, where you off to now?
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
Hello?
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
I'm running away.
Who is it?
Get away from me.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
But I..
That was about as grim as it gets.
What's wrong?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
J. S. Bach.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Now, what was that?
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Know what this is?
Willard...
What is that?
Not again.
When we find him, he is mine.
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
My.  It's gotten longer.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
Dr. Pemberton?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
I beg your pardon?
Hey...!
Thank you, friend.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Why did you say that?
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
You!!
Where's the baby??
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
Did she ask about me?
She said lots of thing.s
Watch it!
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Kill him!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
How am I gonna do that?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Are you sure?
Get back here, Rool!
She's hungry.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Talk!  Say something!
Hey, careful there!
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Don't let them hurt you.
How reliable is this kid?
What have you got?
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
What's your first move?
It's all over, Paul.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
But why would they murder...
Where are you taking us now?
Who are they?
Does anybody know I'm here?
How long have I been here?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Your husband's?
Where's the nearest telephone?
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
You're so sure of that?
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Did you find him?
Everything okay?
Good morning.
Who was that man?
That has no place in this house.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
No, Rachel...
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
He'll live.
Is this where we're going?
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Uhhhh -- yes...
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
I thought you said she was dead.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Oh --
...bed.
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
We might.
Dorothy!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Who's her?  Who's her?
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
I'll be home in time for supper!
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
...yes.
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Did I scare you?
Um-hmm.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
...along.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Dorothy next!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
What happened?
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Not even a rhinoceros?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
You don't get around us that easy!
To Oz?
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Oh, dear, dear.
...to Dorothy!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
Yeah --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
What about us?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
Stop that dog!
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What the hell are you talking about?
Is there another way?
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
It’s just a scratch.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
I met you at my father’s funeral.
No!  It will cave in!
I don’t want to be safe!
What the hell are you doing here?
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
I’m coming with you.
I could have given you the world.
What?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
A whore fucking.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
What -- am I --
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Jon, where are we?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Old?
This'd better not be what I think it is.
What the hell -- ?
They're following us.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
. . . That was quick.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
What caused it?
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Their real names, please.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
I'm terribly sorry.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's a little farther gone every time.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
New information.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
What do I get out of it?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
But programmable. And expendable.
What game is that?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Where are you going?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Did you do your homework?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
Nothing. He had two days.
I think I'll hang on to these.
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
You're serious?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What's wrong with him?
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'll tell you one thing though.
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Let go.
He's uptight.
What is it you intend to do to me?
Don't you knock?
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
I lost him.
Is it enough?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
Darling!
And your passport?
Does that mean you love me?
Goodbye, darling.
Love me?
What a strange fellow.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Good night.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
What?
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
But, sir...
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Are these your bags?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
There wolf!  There castle!
Aye-gor!
But what you were doing?
Did you hear that strange music?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
No, no!  That whole thing!
How's it going?
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Come on, big fellow!
Get the sedative ready!
MMMmmmmmm.
Ooh!
Look, Doctor!
It wasn't me.
Do you think you can sing it?
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
What?
Yes, I have mine.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
His what??
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
