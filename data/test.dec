Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Cameron.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Then that's all you had to say.
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No.
Who?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Expensive?
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
What?
I guess I'll never know, will I?
So did you
You set me up.
Perm?
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
He seems like he thrives on danger
I thought you hated those people.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's her favorite band.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Not at all
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
No fear.
Who cares?
Who?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Funny, you're the only one
Sure, I do
Unwelcome.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Fallacy.
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Oh huh
I thought you were punishing me.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Just smack her now.
Oh yeah.
Right.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
We're your guys.
But -- who -- what --?
Absolutely not.
We'll all go crazy...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
I am, Your Eminence
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I am busy inside.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
There'll be a time.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Chief says -- he has a God.
He understands.
You never learned how to speak my language.
So was Christ!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
Oh?  So you are a new man?
What did they say about Granada before today?
Thank you.
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
The land is there.  I know it!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Then why?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Can I see your back?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
So...the station is empty?
They're not gonna send you right back.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Okay.  But not water sports.
End my career?
Vodka tonic.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
A timer.
No, what is it?
Pretty.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
I'm on duty.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
My point exactly.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright?
Alright.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
I'm not.
Answer the phone.
Yeah.  I promise.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
I am butcher.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
You'll be my first.
Where's Czech girl?
Yes sir.
Two weeks holiday.
How long are you planning to stay?
I want to document my trip to America.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Shut up.
Credit?
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
What are you doing here?
You want the tape?  There it is!
I want to hear everything he said.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
What are you coming here to do?
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Clean?
But you knew that, right?
He knew all along.
Not good.
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
She's wonderful.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Yes.
That seems very unlikely.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
What is it, Hal?
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
In three days, darling, I hope.
She's in the bathroom.
Yes, Daddy.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Fine.
Are you quite sure?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
I will if I can, Frank.
How about chargin' the battery?
Great, just great.
Vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Here's hoping, baby...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Thank you.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
You have a good time?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You stay with me...
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Don't worry about it.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
So do you...been a long day.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
When? How?
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
So what?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Shut up.
Yeah, old times.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Five bills.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Napoleon... small.
No thank you.
They are robots!
So you do know her.
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
When is she not in trouble?
And then?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
How many points you got left on your license?
Leeloo..
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
We will be ready, Lord.
Have you pulled yourself together?
This is a police control action..
I don't think this is a good time...
Why not?
...Hoppi-hoppa.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I told you not to read all that crap!
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Exactly.
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Actually only one cell survived..
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Wonderful!
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
To fame.. salud..
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
I understand.
... What's going on?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Mrs. Christian.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
What you see is what I got, mister.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Hmm.
And they are?
I'll consider it.
We can do that.
Right here.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
What are you... ?
I remember him.
Leave him alone.
Call me Tom.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
I don't know...
Yeah.
It was a lot of fucking money.
You enjoy it?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Show me where you buried her.
Don't think I won't.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I'm listening.
I was well compensated.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Enlighten me.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
There's not much illegal.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Sounds good, pops.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
See ya.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
No.
The checks were for odd amounts...
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Yes, but...
No.
I don't know.
Okay.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Who are you?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
What's wrong?
I can't find him.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You're his sister, right?
Kristen's story really got to her.
Three days.
Is there something we can do?
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
She knew she was gonna die.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
Huh?
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
You're right.
To take a picture.
Since my little girl became a mom...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
But Dad --
Had kind of a long night.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Krueger is reality.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I don't know!
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Stick around, please?
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
So they caught up with you, too?
Huh?
A lot of people think like that.
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
The sound again?
Somewhere down there?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Right, Skipper.
Yes, Griff?
Something wrong?
Anything ---
What about time...?
Under <u>water</u>?
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
- for horrors like yourself?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
Obviously.
Thank you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
How soon?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You can't buy Wade off.
That was me.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Yeah.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You played for the Sox?
Sun's gettin high.
In the chest.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.
I don't want to.
It's stupid.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Where's the plow?
Fuck you.
I figured you already heard.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
Mel Gordon.
Yeah.
Forget it.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
But not now.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Jack?
He got his deer yet?
Atta-go.
Sleeping.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Crawl!
Wade?
Who?
No thanks. I don't drink.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Well, I never heard that one.
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
I'm sure he's busy.
Alice...
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
Hey, you guys back already?
Alice... I...
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
I'm doing what I can.
Lemme take a look.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
To swear you in as President.
Yes, Mr. President.
About goddamn time.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Dead.
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Stand by.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
That was war.
No.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Jim...
Over my dead body.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
They've gotta be joking.
Yes, sir.
Can't it wait?
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Both of you.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Yes, sir.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I was reading too.
Accelerators down.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted!
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Simon.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I think so.
Roger.
Maybe.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Sure.
Yeah.
All right.  Here.
Sixteen 'C', why?
What should I say?
Don't try to stop me!
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
No. I'm all alone.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
A hospital? What is it?
Well...
Ted!
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
I love you, Elaine.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Uh-huh.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Who wants to be first?
Yes, Captain?
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Your mother mates out of season.
You are married?
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Why?
Nothing.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Who else can I ask around here?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Position?
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Yes.  That follows.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Sorry to disappoint you.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
They're but off!  Do something!
Sir?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Are you finished?  You okay?
Aye-firmative.
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Fuck you.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
No.. I've slept enough.
What about me?
They're dead.
You promise?
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Look!
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Newt, wait!
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Indeed.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
A brothel.
Don't bother.
I'm so relieved.
Sir -
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
I want to go!
Why? People fart backwards.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Eat my - ah!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Don't be stupid.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
I can't write it!
It's killing me.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Yes.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
What for?
What do you mean?
But! I'm a married woman!
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
He needs me, ma'am.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Money! Money!
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Twenty-six.
I will.
That's not what I hear.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Papa!
Good morning, sir.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Animals?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Can I see it?
Why not?
Madame.
Ah!
What exactly are you working on?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Do you mean that?
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
I think so.
Yes!
You go fast!
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
My son, no one can speak for God.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes?
Never mind.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Who is she?
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
What happened to them?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Yes, sir.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Warn him?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Yes, I should think so.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Tea would be nice.
Call me Alex.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
That's not really a very proper question.
Twenty-eight.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Will you come with me?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Not just a patient -- me.
Charming.
Lovely.
Yes?
Do me an enormous favor?
Werewolves simply do not exist.
I'm freezing.
Don't you remember?
Pull over.
Will you shut up!?!!
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Oh, come on, tell us.
You could have told them!
I was having a nightmare.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
So they said.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Wrong.
Come on, I'm freezing.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Yeah.
Walk away, Jack.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
What?!
Stop it, Jack.
Nurse!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Hi, David.
Hello.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
No.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Just pure luck!
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
You understand?
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
You don't have to do nothing.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Why, I needed a—
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
My apartment.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Tomorrow night?
Mr. Sampson . . .
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Yes, sir.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Matt, come here!
With what?
Oh, ten dollars—
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yeah.
Oh, Charlie again.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Mr. Williams . . .
Yes, why?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Then where were you?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
What?
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Leave me alone, Bob.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Tell me.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
I got us through the War all right.
And I'm the better outlaw.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Which one, right or left?
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Ho-yah!
You're right, sir.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Mm-hmm.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Bob's upset.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Jim was old enough...
They're making him a hero now.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Shush.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Me neither.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
"Hmm" what?
You are a hell of a woman.
Right here in church?
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You been with a girl ever?
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I just though you were awful cute.
Lyla Devereux.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Really?
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
They had to be dealt with!
And it is my pleasure to be here.
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
I look forward to seeing it.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Eight?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Yes, dear.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
What do you want, Courtney?
I never knew you smoked.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Yes?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No, he doesn't.
There was no ad in the Times.
What exactly do you mean?
Where are you going?
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Two at nine? Perfect.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Just...say...no.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Yes, Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
You're at Paul Owen s.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Thanks.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Hmmm.
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Eerie. Really eerie.
Don.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Al.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Yes, Owen?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
You can't just walk in, either.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
Nothing.
...Why?
...Different?
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Yes sir.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
He's pretty tight with his family.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Talk about work? Never!
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
'Have a look?
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Let's go.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Got out of my other commitment.
Where we going?
Why would you do a thing like --
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
The dishes are juiced up, too.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
But you said the other --
Wait a second. He knows I know.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
What d'you mean?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
I could get it out of him.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Thank you, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Thanks.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Yes Basil?
Hey, Mick!
Good on ya, man.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Excuse me?
A Chigro?
Sure.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
Here, use mine.
He's too well-protected right now.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Danger's my middle name.
That's not mine.
What are you saying, son?
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Dr. Evil?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Great.
He's asleep.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Seriously?
... bottle ...
Love...
... love...
I have an appointment.
Eh? In here!
Hmmm ...
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
We want to help...!
Next assignment?
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
I'm already married ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
And just what is the game?
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Do you really think so?
As per mother's instructions.
I meant me.
An eccentric recluse?
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Very good, Steed ...
Is there anything that isn't?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Orders.
I thought you didn't.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
You lied.
You first.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Have a look at this.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Pity your mother came, too ...
Decontamination -- ?
I see.
Who's now vanished.
... and now?
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Global warming?
We want Mrs. Peel.
She may try to kill you.
Where?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Perish the thought.
That's not playing by the rules.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
You're kidding.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What is this person's story here?
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The best.
I'm very happy for you two.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Mr. Thomerson.
Sure have...
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
1002.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
What's the matter?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
I am committed. I love you.
Yes...
Let's get naked.
Yeah.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Let's have a toast.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Screw that.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Can't I just maim it a little?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The phone made me do it!
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
The best table in the house.
Oooooo.
I don't know.
Got me.
Very.
Take care.
I'm saved. Let's party!
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
Yeah? What about Laura --
I'm in heaven, Lt.
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
-- Never mind.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
What are we going to do about this?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Leave Stephen out of this --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Yes.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
It's a small town.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Trychticholorate.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
What reason?
Are you going public with this?
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Yeah.
Like it never happened...
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Backdraft.
Coffee sucked.
I'll be there.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
The great communicator.
Okay.
You treated me like shit.
He's out.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
And old ladies?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Yeah.
Who?
I'm a Catholic.
Yes.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
All right, cop. I want my money.
Let me think about it.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
B-L-A-K it is.
Did he gots to be.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Please.
Delacroix.
What do I do?
Meaning?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Different.
And this is Manray.
Did we get our bill yet?
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
EUREKA!!
To what?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
How you sound?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
Calm down, please.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
It's me, Peerless.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Where do you go from here?
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
Is that so?
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Manray!
Do you know how you will use him?
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Which one is your brother?
Everybody shut up.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
I thought it was appropiate.
Please don't go there.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
No.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
Yeah.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
I'll be right over.
I can't go all the way down south.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Not at all?
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
What do you mean?
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Oh her.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
...I heard different, thought that was...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
What do you want to know?
Are you trying to rap to me?
And what?
That is none of your business.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Your cousins go out with him.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Your honor must lower his voice.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Yes, sir.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I have faced that problem before.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Certain?
That is a trifle strong.
Have you had one?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
Agreed.
Then you must get it.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
As much as possible.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Yes, of course.
I see.
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
What do we do?
We found him like this --
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
HEY!
Shut up, Mueller.
What do you mean, alone?
Shut up.  West's dead.
Okay.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
He's lying.
I'm serious --
You saw West's body.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
And the bodies?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Epilepsy.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
The creek bed --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Would you have believed me?
Sir, yes, sir!
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Yeah...
You're the only one missing a grenade.
But not the only victim, right?
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
I didn't do anything --
I don't know --
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
What the hell are you talking about --
That's horseshit and you know it.
The Senator...
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
You're crazy --
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Yes.
Good cop/bad cop?
Best time for banal chit-chat.
I lost a bet.
I plan to grow on you.
Got it.
Watch me.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Let's go talk to Bill...
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Good idea.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Good, just making sure.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Fifty minutes.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
What?
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
What the fuck are you doing?
We're not going anywhere.
Shut up!
Yeah.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
We know.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Yes!
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
No one's ever left.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
No.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
I can get it. I can just...
Go.
That's terrible.
Stop.
Please?
I never knew.
Okay.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Am I?
Did you do any of that?
You think I'm up for it?
Really.
You mean, while I'm here.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You say...
Story of my life.
Yes. Exactly.
Go out with me.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Because he's dying.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Probably tonight.
They met at Auburn.
You're not.
Of course.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
Yes?
Yes. Thank you.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
What do you mean?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Uh... Yes.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
Good night.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Syevodnya
It's makes it easier. Okay.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
Well as it turns out I did.
I don't want to talk about him.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
But, you know, so what?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
It's alright.
Thanks.
You hurt it?
You take her to a doctor?
At church?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Yeah.
Now wait...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
What?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Or what?
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Uh-uh.
I don't fuckin' cook.
I can handle that.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Don't know if God wanna see me.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Ain't gonna be moved?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Yes'sir.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
What's on your mind?
You feelin' sick?
Holy shit!
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Home.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Let go...
Charlie...
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Number five with a bullet.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Hey, when in Rome --
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
What's the problem here?
Why weren't you at the platform?
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Ichiro --
You were too far behind.
Gaiijin.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Shut-up.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
I couldn't tell.
I don't know.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
I need someone to translate for me.
The cheese...
Guess I'm on a roll.
Time, I've got plenty of.
I'm amused.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Look.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Come here.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
You're just all so... so different.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Got it.
Yeah.  I got it.
Your customer, eh?
Day after tomorrow.
Why, yes, of course.

My pleasure.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
No.  I got a problem.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
No rust?
What night?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
I don't know nothing about it.
For holes.
You mean the snake.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Not too good.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Because it's not.
What?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Black?
Go ahead.
Five, maybe six.
Discreetly.
Don't move.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
But how come I'd be there?
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
We sure did.
For how long?
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
What?!
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
You don't?
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Get away from me!!
Oh, I could die...
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Take it. damn it!
No.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Sure.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
A wife?
Everybody's divorced.
The engine is still running.
I like it.
Uh...yeah.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Good-bye!
Not that one!
And don't be so obvious!
No way.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
What?
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Shit is a French word?
I'll try.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh, I think they have.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
What?
My father is a genius.
How old do I look?
Up there!!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
What about relatives?
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Yes.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Yes, dear!
Then after that it's safe.
I'm not hungry.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
And I made these!
Just open the door.
--and we will--
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Some time.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
No.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
We'll find him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Come on.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
It must be great.
Okay.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yes sir. I sure am.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Frank is coming?
That's good.
Yes.
Frank would open you.
Kiss me.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Alright, suit yourself.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
What?
Yes.
Okay Frank.
This is it.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
No. No thank you.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Am I bothering you?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Why not?
Yes.
That's what I thought.
Goodnight.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Stop it Mike.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Yes mother.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
I can't find the second one, sir.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
This is a six-shooter.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
I-I'll tip her.
What?  What, that guy?
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Aye.
For what?
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
A bit.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
And he is one smart man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Uh... two shooters!
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Where's my cat?
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Sicilians.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Why was I not informed of this?
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Who were the victims?
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
I...
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You feel?
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
The... The funny man.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
She's an attractive older woman.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Yeah, I saw it.
Yeah.
Just turn right here.
You're right. You're right.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What do you think?
Look at the treads on those.
Sure.
What. What's the matter?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
On the left.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Yes... It's true.
Where was it parked?
This morning.
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
Shh.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
How much?
She needed it.
Ah. Couple days ago.
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Let me feel that.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I'm sorry, Bob.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Hang on a second.
It's going back down.
Careful. Check his pulse.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
He stole a tractor.
Thanks.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Hold it.
That sounds like Dignan.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Why'd you want to help us?
I hope not.
Move.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Jesus Christ! No.
I didn't do anything.
Who's got the car keys?
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Temporarily.
Like silk?
Abdul-Shabazz?
Is that Buckethead?
What's he doing here?
True.
Bob! Get back in position!
You're the faggot.
I don't know about that.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
That never would of --
I'll just drive my car.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
I told you he's crazy.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
Let's just go.
His name was Swifty?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
No. I was calm.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I told you they were there.
There were more than that.
My brother's in jail.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Run. Run. Let's go.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
He said what?
26 weeks.
Yes.
Who? Applejack?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
She is a good looking woman.
Fight. You know.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Anything else?
What do you mean?
Bourne comes here? Why?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
...this is Conklin's computer.
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Don't know.
'Why' would be enough for me.
No. You lost your way.
Okay.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
You're a liar.
I can't let you do that either.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Felt a little light.
Sorry. Old habits.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
I worry when you get like this.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
The Telegraph office.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
He was at the campground yesterday.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
There must be another way!
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
No. You never worked Berlin.
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
I'm working on it.
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
Here?
Is there. Is all there.
Me? Four years.
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
And why is that?
So?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Are we hacking or asking?
I don't want to leave.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
The Scots will fight for us?
Wallace's followers.
I rest.
That depends on the man.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Let her speak.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
It's battle I want, not talk.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
I must... consult with my father.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
What is it?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
And the bad news?
But you must have something to go on?
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Okay.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
What? What could he do?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
No, protecting her.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Photos?
I'm sorry.
Hi, Lenny.
So it didn't feel... weird?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
I walk differently?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
I get it. You can drop it now.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Why's that?
Yeah?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Know what?
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Evan Treborn.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Deal. Now read me something.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
I thought I was the bad guy!
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Yes?
I came with Captain Renault.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
-- Will he keep his word?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Yes, Monsieur.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Come up here a minute.
It's not for sale.
Well, so long.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
Occupied France?
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
What are they?
I will.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Looking for a job.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Yes.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
No.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
And Laszlo?
All except one. He won't have you.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
No.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Goodnight.
He suggested I ask you.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Thank you. I try.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Thank you.
Yes, I get the point.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
We'll be there.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Good day.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
How about New York?
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
But I have no excuse to close it.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
What, again?
Yeah? What's his name?
Why two?
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Excuse me.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Huh?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Put that gun down.
Sacha, she's had enough.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Yeah?
No.
No.
Good. Then have a drink.
Just a little something of my own.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
Worse than Warsaw.
You've had today's water.
Take it, damn it.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
I'm putting it off.
Why do they have to die for me?
No!
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
You are.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Had a package to deliver.
I had it on the island with me.
I thought I did.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Could you watch Jango?
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I would have done the same thing.
Is that Jango?
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Not when you have no choice.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
I most definitely say I am.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Mom, meet Jango.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
Can you find her?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
It was fifteen minutes late.
But I might not have.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
It's me.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
Want to see my raft?
Hallelujah.
No sweat.
San Francisco.  And you?
You weren't dreaming about me.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Dr. Homer Wells.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
I know.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Two.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
"King Kong". It's really good.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Right.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
Nothing.
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Please don't...
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Well, they aren't.
I know what you've been doing.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
He's leaving...
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
His father's dead, right?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
What about the trees?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Right.
I guess so...
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Where'd she get you?
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Yes, for both.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
That's it.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
We see you next harvest.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Everything looks in order.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Two million.
Know who I am, Jake?
It's not true.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
So what? We just stay clear of him.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
Well, this is just fucking great...
Two million.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
She's up for it.
Eight A.M. flight.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I can't do that.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
No. Just confidence.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
No thanks. I'm good.
I think I just broke my hand.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Then show me how.
Uh-huh.
It's what I do. It's my job.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
WHAT?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
What about what?
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
And we got rid of the red head.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
With identification.
I'm sorry.
You going to have the time?
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Eee Oott Auught!
In over your head?
Then who's the Banker?
It's not history.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
A Fed? Is he close?
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
Roger that.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Jack Manfred.
Maybe another time.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I'm working on that soccer story.
You want me drunk?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Fine.
It's the truth.
You will?
Never. Why do you ask?
I want to buy a car.
So why did you come to my casino?
First visit to London?
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Then you're not a pro.
Robbery's not criminal?
You're serious.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Wait a minute...
Do you?
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
Who did it? Tell me!
You did?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Turn left at the lights.
Nice car.
You've done pretty well.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
I'll tell you later.
Has he?
We do. 
They've been tested.
What for?
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
How?
Fine.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Bruised.
I think he's talking to it.
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Check at six minutes.
Energy shielding positive function.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Huh?
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
...nine seconds...
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Fred.
I hereby name this star Fred.
Ah, negative drop.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Ah... pity, pity...
Well, what you might try is --
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
What're you talkin' about?
No.
Police drone.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
It's a rule.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
I don't want to move away.
But why can't we stay here?
Are we in some kind of trouble?
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Whoever that is.
Wasn't that hard.
Too early to tell.
Lauren's not my wife.
Yeah...
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
No, I meant this.
You lost me.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
Open it.
Look, thank you for this but--
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
A friend of your fiance's.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
Nothing on Hannah?
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Bastard...
Got a pencil?
You know what I'm saying.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
I have sincere eyes.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
You get it when I get her.
You're the best, Maxie.
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
I'm the victim here.
Exactly.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
You don't.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
I was on call. 
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Bye.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
What's in Sandusky?
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
One more time in English.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Nah. Couldn't be.
And if it ain't cleaned off?
Sure.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
They're what?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
That's it?
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
We won?!
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Yeah.
Donnie.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
I didn't say shit.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
You'll know soon enough.
You have to do something for me first.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
We went to a hotel.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Hey...
Sure.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
What's wrong with you?
Hey. You OK?
But you're OK?
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
When did you stop taking your medication?
Do they know yet?
Where it came from?
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
I met a girl.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
You've done it again?
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
Soon. Time is almost up.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Congratulations.
What I think is going on with your son.
Frank?
Yep.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
I stole four beers from my dad.
She's right over there.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Oh God, I'm dead...
Yeah, you betcha...
Really, Loretta?
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
What?!
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Yeah...
Yes...
Hi.
Then it must be Wednesday.
I know.
Bye.
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Shut it up, Loretta.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
So? Be real easy.
They told me to practice.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Mm-hm.
Ohio...
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Tammy Curry?
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
We need more bars!
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Harold!
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
"My"...
"My dear President"...
But you're my father -
About - thirty-four seconds.
I wanna powder my nose...
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
She did.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
I can't do it...
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
$50?
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
You swine!
You upstart!
Bah!! 
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
The king can do no wrong!
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
I'll join you shortly.
No, I think a whiskey.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
That I am very little different from him.
Yes?
I'll get my bag.
Shut up!
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
And what was that, John?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
You've never been?
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes.
Oh no, my friend...
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Good morning.
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Say "Mmmerrick."
That's a canopy, John.
How is your tea, John?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Good morning.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
I thought as much.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
No, he's very upset about something.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
A dressing bag.
Welcome home, John.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
There IS no one.
You're losing your temper!
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
I said welcome.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
What are what?
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
We never went to bed together.
Who?
The second note to wake the Gods...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
What d'you mean?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
I'm sure it's lovely.
REALLY?
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
You've got to let me go!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Yes.
Shut up.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Find it... AND cross it!
It saved my father!
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
That's my boy!
Make your mind up.
The sun! That's it!
But you're the Gods!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
Like fish.
I've got you!
But...
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Do what?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
No, it is NOT.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Hang on...
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Can't make enough swords!
I know, Dad.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Easy, Dad!
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Yes, Mum.
I never do...
No one.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I don't know what that means.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You know Wilmont?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
You pick it.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Yes.
You'll call me, right?
You didn't say anything about my hair.
You're not ready.
No. Thanks.
I don't know.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
What?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
Is that what you want?
Not yet. Not married.
Okay.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Um, no.
What are you doing?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I think we should go.
Yeah.
Joel, come here. Please.
I don't know.
I can't stop thinking about you.
I just walked in.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Guess what I'm wearing.
Hi.
I'm like a joke to them.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
And what are you like? A wino?
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Well... I did.
Hi.
We'll speak soon.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
I know. Anyway --
It's a good one all right.
Go.
You love him, don't you?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
You better go.
Do you swear you didn't know?
How did I look?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Can I... I brought some --
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
It was a mutual decision.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
She came to help, Howard.
Oh dear.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Yeah.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Save your breath for the climb.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
What is Debbie's position?
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
Tired...
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
I don't know anything about it.
I heard it.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
Hold on, Coop...
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
What?
No, thank you.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
We'll make it.
Hear what?
What happened?
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
His peritoneum has ruptured...
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
Starck!
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
Negative.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know...
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Don't... don't do this...
Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
What makes you think I'll miss?
Then who the fuck are you?
Better if I just show you.
Locked and cocked.
Love to.
We don't have time to fart.
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
That's enough!
Captain, we got a problem.
What is it, Smith?
Come again, Skipper?
I just finished drying...
Radiation interference?
We're all here.
But you can breathe it.
Carbon dioxide?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
Do it. Dr. Weir...
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
What's going on in there, Starck?
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Five seconds.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
No. I'll be right back.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one here.
I did.
Can you shut it down?
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Get them back --
I'm alright. Please.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I'm worried about you.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
And you can? Power it up?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Should?
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Well maybe you should date him.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Got it, teach.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
So are you!
Last one down springs for room service.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Oh, it is.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Right, whatever, have fun.
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
I was talking about us. Working together.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Of course. Of course.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
You were?
Why didn't you say something?
You need a doctor.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Ben did this.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Susan. What are you doing?
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Of course.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
Your friends use the pool too.
Where did you hear that?
See you later.
But they weren't mine.
Okay, Dennis.
Ugh.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
What a guy.
I know what I look like.
He's my friend, too.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I didn't see you this morning.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
Really?
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Chicken!
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I've been swimming, Merv.
All right.
They're fuckin' with us.
Believe it.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
That's the name they gave me.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Aloha, Spicoli.
The point sounds fine.
What about those other guys you live with?
We keep them, in case the people come back.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
I've heard that, too.
Two more Cokes.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
I'd like that.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
A major!
Naw! Not a major.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Not much. Why?
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
He told me he was turning in early...
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Plans?
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Never missed a plane yet.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Yeah.
But it's got teeth.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
We're lucky to be alive.
OPEN THE DOOR!
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
Hey!
Easy.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
No. You?
What?
We lived near power lines.
Well...
But --
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
What?
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
You smell like ass!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
If he doesn't shut up...
BONSAI!
Am I too heavy for you?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
Wait God-dammit!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
GO-GO-GO!!
Let's lock off this room.
We all have to be strong, right?
Um, well...
I said I'm not lying.
I just hit it like you said.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
I'd like nothing better.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
My clothes?
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Who is she?
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Right now we have to be practical.
He knows, Frances.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Claire?
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
We'll get you home, Frances.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
See you next weekend, Dad.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Good.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Fifteen.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
You think I'd miss it?
Quietly.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
What?
Eight stories.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I know.
Think I'll have a glass.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
That's right.
I guess.
Huh?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Oh Harry...
How did I look?
Well... you're looking well.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
'Golden Boy.'
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
You got it.
Yes, Ma.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Mama, what's...
You kill me, Mama.
Not long.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
I'm going out!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
Don't I know you?
Please sit down...
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Frances, I'm warning you...
You're kidding.
What?
Worse.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
How did you find me?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
She's not for you.
Quite right!
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
So have I
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
Only you.
Not as weak as I.
Why the change? What about your work?
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Aye, Captain.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
It's a letter to my father.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
I've been preoccupied.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Despite the lack of challenge.
Victor, explain yourself.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Tomorrow is another day.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Thanks, Alice.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
Artist.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Okay.
Oh, you...
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Is it stuck?
Where's Ned?
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
I said new, this is an '90.
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
In heaven.
Yes, they do.
Yes.
Yes.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
No!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Sure.
What you said to me in the room.
Yes.
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Daddy's dead.
Not many.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Yes.
What?
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
No, I didn't.
This ain't the time.
I did?
What?
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
Where are you right now?
Yeah, it's mine.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
Thank you, ensign.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
No problem, sir!
Fuck me.
I'll act surprised.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Get it up!
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
I saw an article...
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
What about him.
I don't know, I don't care.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
And how do you know that?
You got anybody, Wick?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
Smoke it!
Maybe half.  Not even.
Educate her, Pyro.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
I think you're the liar.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Oh yes he will.
No.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Speak of the devil.
What do I get?
And you're beautiful...
What?
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
You're fast.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
That's right.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Sure.
Makes us look more American.
You were right.
Good idea.
How do I do that?
It's Raymond.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Just don't.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Thanks.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
I'm... I'm shot.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
"Just!?"
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
I had the shot...
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
You have a better plan, Alex?
The guy is terminally selfish!
All this from watching the.. historical records?
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
It's okay. Listen-
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Yeah, what is it?
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Jason..
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Because it was on the show!
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Oh god...
Okay, let's go.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
No.  I guess.
Yes, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
We better, Congress invented him.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Yes, I believe so.
Who's in command out there?
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Detained by what?
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
I understand, George.
George!  So good to be back!
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
They help me understand why we fight.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
It's stupid, of course.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
Just because they are born?
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You're right.
Not too bad.
Your who?
You can talk to me.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
She can't talk right now.
I can't do it.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Leo, I don't know.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
I'm in the movie business.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
But you work for the casino?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Never say anything unless you have to.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
You have it?
Who?
He died.
What Get Away jet?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Like this?
Wait. How about this?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Compass.
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I'm up twelve grand today.
Sit down, Leo.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know what a vig is.
That's right. Three percent.
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I want to know.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
And you think the movie business is any different?
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Harry -–
That's where you got the idea?
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
What money?
Hello, Martin.
A passenger liner. Over.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Morning, skipper.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Why not.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Then what the hell happened to him?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Yeah, yeah.
Sounds reasonable.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Three, four days.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Murphy.
What is it?
How do you mean?
Conveniently enough for you.
If money can buy what he wants.
Then you're a lucky man.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Probably didn't have time.
You're a pal.
Better than starving to death.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
Greer?
February first.
Collision? With what?
But where's the damage?
I don't know, are we?
Showing you what?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Victims of what?
That much I think we've already established.
Epps, over.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Go.
What do you say, Dodge?
How's that?
Moving to Sweden.
Drink up then.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
A what?
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Leave it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
YES.
Not the Maxine?
I guess.
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
Are you going to yell at me?
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
What do you mean?
I didn't check my messages...
You can count on me, sir!
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
No.
I guess.
Then why do you hate me so much?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
You loser.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Just look at them!
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Okay, okay!
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
Which loser?
She says she wants to MMPH!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Which one?
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
I said "great"...
Maybe an orange juice.
It just came yesterday...
Nothing.
That's okay...
Seymour does.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
Tell me what?
Did you bring that tape?
What?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Indian records?
Sure, I guess.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
YAAA!
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
Does that mean you don't like me?
In whatever way you think I mean.
Do you have anything to drink?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
I will if you want to.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
She's not at home?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
As are they all.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
But overall, you're pleased?
Yes he is.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Then why do you stay?
Then we agree. 
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
But you said they were always old.
What did I do?
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
But of course yours worked.
What happened to them?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Didn't I do it?
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
We definitely had a moment or two.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Oh, hello, Peter.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Okay.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
My pleasure.
Yes, the scourge --
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
No, the slime is rising.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
I hate Jello.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
She's new in town.
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Wonder what?
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
Ummm -- figure eight?
Eight o'clock?
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
So what do you think it was?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
That's a violin concerto.
Are you all right?
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
All right.
Goodbye.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I think it's the food of the future.
Here are tonight's calls.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Did you ever report it to anyone?
You could say that.
The magic word is "please."
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
A square?
Then my theory was correct.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
What?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Oh, shit!
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
God, it's ugly!
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
It's not good, Pete.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Judgement Day ...
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Yes?  Go on!
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
You're hearing about somebody else.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Yours will do!
He killed his father and then my family...
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Hello.
I'd love some.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
No.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
That woman. The older woman.
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Because -- I am.
All right then! Yes!
Elaine -- I love you.
Did you say rape her?
Because it isn't true.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
My belt.
No.
Shhhh.
Thank you.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Mr. McQuire.
Ahhh.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Get out!
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Could you bring it up?
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Will you bring it in to me?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
What?
What do you drink?
When is he coming back?
No.
I'm very neurotic.
Like what?
All right. Now finish your drink.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
I know that. But I'm --
Yes, I have --
What if he did?
Jesus Christ!
Yes.
A drink? Of course.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
What?
That's fine.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
I'll be up in five minutes.
Yes.
The number.
What?
You're welcome.
Who said it was my first time?
INADEQUATE!
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Go ahead then.
Neither.
No.
Yes I do.
What novel did you read.
I walk out.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
No we don't.
Not exactly.
Don't tell Elaine.
What?
Yes.
Kind of.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Then let's hear them.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
I wouldn't know.
You're not.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Thank you.
Then give me your word you won't.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I'll find her.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Sure.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
But I don't want you to make up something.
To be what?
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
I've got to go.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
I'd like to hear it.
I will.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
I'd like to discuss this.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
They are?  Come on.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Not now.
No.
I could take care of her.
With the pearls?
Who?
Have you seen it?
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
All right. We'll dance.
Will you do me a big favor?
I feel sorry for him.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
How tired you are!
Am I quite strange to you?
And...?
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
You are beautiful!
What?
I want to be alone.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Yes.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
No?
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
We could come to my room.
Ready, Baron.
All of that at once, Baron?
I must have made a mistake.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No, Doctor.
Nobody, Doctor.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
Stay where you are.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, don't go.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Yes.
I never danced before -- in public.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Moreover...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Can't you understand me?
Definitely off.
Hello!
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Well, he's a gentleman!
Why not?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
And I said we didn't.
Then, it's all over?
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
He likes to play the great man.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Goodnight, Suzette.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
I wish to be alone.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
That.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
I know.
What is?
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
So I heard.
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Perk.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Only one tooth?
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I don't?
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
What?
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Scram. Go home.
All? It ain't bad.
You already went back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
Yeah? How?
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
I'm happy the way I am.
Thank you.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
You up to it now?
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Girl scouts.
The cemetery...
Sweet dreams, Blake.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Do I know you?
... I think it would be best if you both left.
It's Amy Kramer.
I think someone broke into my house.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Nothing's missing?
Forget it.
Nothing.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Get on the bus.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
You stole it?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
Okay... thank you.
Who?!
Looks great.  It does.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Oh, right.  Sorry.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Can't you hold it?
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Where's Shane?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
He's in the bathroom.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
The voice man!  He's here!
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
He says things.  Bad things.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Here.  Let me try.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
No!!!
I dunno, boy.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
The posies are for her?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
I just want one true adventure before I die.
What?
As a matter of fact--
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Are you--do you--
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Dr. Woodly.
She met him at college.
What's good about that?
Mhravitch.
Where did you get the poison?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
It's your house, Dad.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought a doctor might help.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
Say hello to your mother.
It's so--so stark.
I have a brain.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
You're wrong.
People don't use that word any more.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
What are you going to do?
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Just one favor.
I see.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Don't!
Stop!
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Out!
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
He's dead, you know.
Hello, Mother.
We'll miss you so.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I was going to ask.
What for?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
You haven't heard me yet.
We'll find out now, won't we?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Comical?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
I've enjoyed being man.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
She did?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
I don't want to live any more.
I didn't know that.
No.
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
That's something I suppose.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Take plenty of cigars.
Meaning?
We've got to rescue him.
He's not your son.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
Penelope!  We're late!
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
He died of a massive rupture.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Yes, we do.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Do you want to take a session?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Well, I want to...
Are you going to stiff me?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
How many weeks?
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
You're not a film producer, are you?
Three hundred?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
She's dead.
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
But it's all you do.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Why can't I meet him now?
Where does he live.
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
But then you'll forget about me.
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
What's it called?
But the police...
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
I just heard. Who is he?
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
What plan?
I want to meet Ratan.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Rucker.
Who?
Film making can be pretty expensive...
What exactly do you have in mind?
What do you think of that? Or this?
You never heard of that?
Oh.
I'm worried about Jake.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You're taking a big chance.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Harold Chasen.
Nice to meet you.
Eh, no.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Your hearse?
Oh.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
What do you mean?
I don't know. Just one of those. 
Well...
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
But what?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Is he all right?
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
What was that?
I like you, Maude.
It's so blue.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Well, they're my species.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, Harold. 
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
To whom?
At a funeral.
Harold!
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No. My uncle.
Like a tea ceremony?
A rough estimate.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
I don't know.
Huh?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Eh?
Souvenirs?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
I knew you'd come.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
It certainly is.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
God, that's terrible.
What?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
WHY?
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Is he serious??
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
He's just going through a phase --
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Don't move. We --
You call that thing a cigar??
My job.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hostage negotiations.
Not from you.
Good night.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Alone?
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Marco...
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
Not much.
We're leaving.
Sure.
Julia's my second wife.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's just a puzzle box.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
It's important.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
No.
One last time. Give me the box.
Poor baby.
Oh.
Oh.  Oh yes.
I don't want to see the dress.
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Oh my God.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
What do you want me to do.
Good.
Keep your voice down.
Who did?
You're still afraid.
Yes. They'll never find us.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
I have to see my father.
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You mean we're moving in?
Why not?
I'll be scarred for life.
I'm here.
Please...
Not much.
Please.
There's a first time for everything.
Do you care ?
Maybe I will.
Am I?
What happened to me?
Steve.
YOU'D like my room.
Never better. You sleep well.
Gone?
What's the problem?
So lie down.
If there's a train.
Oh no.
Your father told me you were working here.
What things?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Oh, so what's the point then?
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
But now I kind of like it.
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
Ehh.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Ha.
What band?
How many tickets can I put you down for?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
We're getting that anyway.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
It's the new --
On Clark Street!
We work there!
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
What do you mean, four more?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Think about it, Rob.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
I guess.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
You're being deliberately obtuse.
Well, think about it.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Hi.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Okay.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Harder.
Wanna go to dinner?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
Hey.  It's Liz.
How're you holding up?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
It's true!
Well she --
It's a crematorium.
Everything go alright?
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Oh, right.  Alright.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Everything all right?
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Sixty.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
It's my birthday.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Have you gone to the police?
You are being foolish.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
It's beautiful.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
He knows about you.
You kill with your left hand?
Come here, Brenna.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
Yes.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Your name is Conor?
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Pheasant.
It is less.
No!
No!
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
I feel hardly nothing.
I have no future husband.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Like you.
Mulet.
It can be different.  It must be.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Your father must be smart.
You'd think he'd had practice.
He knows I'm here.  How?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Head still secure to the neck.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
-Since you last saw me.
I've had a few more concerns.
You're wrong.
Of sorts.
This isn't done.  Get up.
And if I refuse?
I presume it's a sword.
Your murder weapon?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
When may I expect the cleaners?
No.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Hildy!
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
The poem?... The poem was great!
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Hello, Bruce...
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Yes!
No -- she didn't.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
No. My mother.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Thanks a lot.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Gee! Take a look, will you?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Just what I said. That's what I --
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Get away, Svengali.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
The insurance business?
What for?
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
I know. Where is he, I said.
I know, but --
I'd like to think.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Where's some paper?
Where's Butch?
Where's Bruce?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What did you do with her?
Louie!
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Don't tell me you were worried!
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
What would you do if it was a daughter?
What's the matter with my brains?
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
You -- you!!
What's that -- what's that?
You got plenty of money?
I'm busy, Duffy.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Me, too.
Yes, sir.
Three bullets! Any good?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
Little rum in yours, too?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Hold her, boys!
What do I know about Williams?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
What do you mean -- through?
I did.  Hold the wire.
Now what do you say?
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
I'm telling you!
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Huh?
Mother!
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
Keep away!
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Quiet, Mollie!
Ssh!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Get the Governor on the phone!
Huh?
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
A very fine-looking women.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
Come on, fellas.
Say, Hildy...
We want to see you.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
But Grandpa, you said...
Apparently so.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
They're not.
I don't mind.
Bugger off.
Could.
Pauline.
It's like telling fibs.
Air-raid?
Propaganda. We've been had.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
What's that?
Oh, that.
Jam.
You taste it.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Who said anything about love?
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Play something, Grace.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
No, I told you...
Where's that?
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Yeah, come on.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Now, what makes you think that?
Hey, wait take this.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Yeah, no shit.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Way out here?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Yeah, showtime for what?
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
There's a dog in the road.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
It won't work.
What I need are some answers. 
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
I hear ya.
I don't want to see that.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
Shhhhhh.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Sleeping.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
You find something, Georgie?
Keys.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Let's go see.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Fit the profile?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
Aw, fuck.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
Right...  ...come on.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's going famously, son, famously!
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Woof.
Oui.
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
That would be good.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
I just want to talk.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
We still have you and I.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
It's okay, Puff.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Really?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Lila, I want to help you.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
Oh, Rosie.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
How's it going?
What's the larger experiment?
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I don't think so.  Why?
What?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
I think he's feral.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Nothing. Be right out.
Your entire body?
I have to think! I have to think!
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Good. Making progress.
That's great.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
I guess.
I had sold my fucking soul.
Oh boy!
Absolutely!
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Ugnh.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
I have to talk. Is that okay?
Yes?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Mm hmm.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
Do we need words?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
Thank you.
That's the way it's done.
You ever played billiards before?
Deal the cards.
Oh, about five hundred.
What is?
A thousand.
What's that supposed to mean?
To do what?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
How good is he?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Where?
'Bout even.
I don't know.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
Fast and loose, man.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Yeah. Just like that.
How much?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
Oh no, nothing for me.
What bus?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
Yeah. For a little while.
Me. It's Eddie.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Come here. Come on, now.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
California. Oakland.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Thousand dollars a game.
Let's go.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
With them?
We move.  Place to place.
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
We don't know that --
Have you always had it?
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
Do we have to?
Because the sky is so clear out here.
Okay.
What did it look like?
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I left it at work.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
I'd believe him.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
The back door was open.
What?
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
What kind, Mom?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
You have to leave the White House.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Did it work?
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
So sue me.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Can't this thing go any faster?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
She didn't take my name when we were married.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
What'd I say?
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
Just getting a feel for her.
But Mr. President...
ETA with target; four minutes.
And our troops here?
Roger.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
Yes, I am.
Butt-munch.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
I'm a dancer.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
How to kiss ass.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
We should leave too.
You are on your own?
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
Arghhh! Oh!
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Yes?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
In that case, I permit you.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
The Grail Diary.
I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
Out!
Don't call me that, please.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Yeah?
Don't worry. He won't.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
Head for the fireplace!
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
Relax.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Fly... yes. Land... no.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
You call this archaeology?
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
"J".
We named the dog Indiana.
Come on -- come on!
No.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
Miss Scott panicked?
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Lao She.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Step on it, Short Round!
No.
Yeah, that's what happened...
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Two are still missing.
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
A SNAKE!!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
Just one arm!
It's starting to let go!
I know the feeling...
Just try and control yourself.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
Don't catch cold.
What -- the bug?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
A what?!
No... they won't kill me.
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
Not quite.
And they don't even know what it really is.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
Don't do that.
I just got here.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
That a new Datsun?
I just went there for a job.
Loading a gun.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Why not?
Oh...Gooood!
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Too late...They want you.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
You gotta help.
I can't remember..
What do you mean?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
What am I supposed to do?
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
Just get there.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Good Idea!
The sand.
Eat it.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What's happening?
Don't just stand there, say something.
Where are you staying?
No...you idiot!
...Rene...
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Well you did it today.
What are you looking at?
This...is not going to work out.
It is my business. It's my name.
That place. By the window.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Just hold them close and stay still.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What if she says something important?
Shit! You're in love.
No. What will you do.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Run, stupid!
That's not funny.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
Never mind, just say it.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Come on.
And don't let her know, either.
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Where've you been?
About what?
Yeah, sure.
You're lovely.
It'll remind me of you.
What part what?
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
Then how did you know?
Surveilliance on them all.
He's not an ordinary man.
And how do you service foreigners.
I think I've heard of you.
What about it?
Do what?
Who...are you?
Oh.
What?
Not you. Them.
I don't know Who.
Been hearing voices.
You...him...UST.
Nothing.
...I'm looking for someone.
Where?
Oh...I can't. Business.
...Rene.
I just work for the travel firm.
You talk to yourself.
...Naw. Made that up.
They kidded me a little.
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Why?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
He plays it all the time.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
This going to work?
They asked about you.
Why?
But you did it. It was you.
I know a nice island.
Why are you on to him?
Why'd you invite me here?
Thank you.
Yes, baby?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Maybe later.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
Lunch?
No, I'm not...
Before you go...
What caliber is your gun?
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Okay.  Lowell?
Don't you have to be at the office?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I'm doing an interview.
Who's calling?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
I'm alone on this...
No, you do not.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
You eating with us?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Alright. What did you think?
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
It's obvious, isn't it?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
What?!
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Liane has filed for divorce...
Where you staying now?
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
A delivery device for nicotine.
It acts as a...
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Seven...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
Well, I wouldn't say --
Howard!
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
I had no idea until after, but --
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
Triple!
Grounds?
Sustained.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
No frown lines.  New watch?
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Thanks, buddy.
Yes?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
But you don't agree?
You don't believe in it.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Marylin! Listen to me.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
She didn't love you?
Your mother was.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Yes. Again.
I know.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I bet.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
You can't prove anything.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Marylin?
No buts. Now. Out.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Forgery? Fraud?
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Marylin?
You used his credit card.
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
She did a Harriman.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
He has a reputation for being tough.
Oh, God!
So where are you now?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Hello Miles.
I want to be exposed.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Yes?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
I don't know. I can assume...
She brought my digestive enzymes.
Nothing.
Sorry.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Muriel Rumsey.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
Why don't you put me in chains?
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
South America.
I'll get it annulled.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Oh, yes. I heard.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
He's marvelous!
I'm sorry you read it.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Lower the boats!
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Sock her!
Yes, of course.
What do they say?
But the lady says—
Huh?
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Yes.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
You must have me confused with—
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
That's none of your business.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
The pleasure is all mine.
Outside!
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Well, you were!
Next week "East Lynne."
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
Not as long as I'm alive.
To New York?
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
Well, take them off.
know—but—
was so scared—that it scared—
Hitch-hiking.
Raw?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Amazing.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
Yeah, swell.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
I'm out! I'm out!
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Isn't he here?
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Oh, excuse me. 
Yes?
Just your imagination.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Okay, pete. 
When you sober up—come in and see me.
I ain't got a hat.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Who?
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
What's the other name?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
No, I did not.
Dave, do you think we're out of our minds?  The whole building's been a zoo since that broke.  We can't get a thing done.  Reporters crawling everywhere.  You think we want that?
What did they...
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
There were admirals.
What?
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
A Perry Russo?
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
David Ferrie.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Huh?
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
They're gonna love you, chief.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
More than ten years.
Never touched me.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
The assassination, Jack?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Yes?
Virginia.
Uh huh.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
I need a favor.
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Course you didn't.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
Sure.
What's in it?
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
What's her name?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Shit.
Sure.
Ordell pick up his bond?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I didn't?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
How many trips did you make?
Cash poor?
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Are you?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
What'd ya see?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
I don't care.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
What if I've figured a way?
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
I hesitated taking that much.
I'm sure.
What's he doing?
I didn't say you did.
I'm just tired in general.
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
If I'm working, I can help you.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
What are you doing?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
So what happens now?
Buy ya a beer?
Great...  ...Wanda!
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Beaumont Livingston?
Kinda.
Dreaming.
Do you got something for me?
I was expecting you. Come in.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
Who?
A woman.
Uh-huh.
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
I can sit through it once.
Sure.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
No thanks.
The roller disco one.
You been to Japan?
You lived in Japan, when?
That sounds like a problem.
Sure.
This one.
That's good money.
Okay.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
I dunno.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
You said five hundred and fifty!
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Watcha gonna see?
Have fun.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Haven't a clue.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Yes.
I got some more business for ya.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
What?
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
That I gotta see.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Yes.
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
I was gonna tell you...
Give me his home number.
I'm okay.
How do you know?
Me, too.
Just my luck.
That's right. We did.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Tell your mother.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Why do you say that?
But the paper ...
An explosion, just like Paul's.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I haven't seen her in months.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I don't know what to say.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Hell, you think I am?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I don't want to know.
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
Don't ask.
I don't let anybody call me that.
A good lay.
The best.
Not to me.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
When was the last time I said a word?
Where?
The numbers stop at 107.
That's your decision.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Am I home?
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
Why didn't you call me?
What? What do you mean?
Let go!
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
I'm tired.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
The Ladder?
What is it?
One drop?
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
If you're lucky.
What is wrong with you?
That's a lie. My family was here.
Paul Gruneger!
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
What's wrong?
What's goin' on Paul?
Who is?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
Why not?
Died?
How did it happen?
Done?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
He....He...
What are you gonna do, tell me?
Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Thorgan? You coming?!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
You just keep an eye out.
What?
Where is he?
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
I hope so.
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Guys!!! The shuttle?
No you don't!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Okay, good tip.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
You lost the charge?
GO, GO, GO!
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
Let's just get out of here.
You're leaving me here alone?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Am I in there?
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
I love you.
He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
Ssh.
I just know.
Obviously so.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
It's okay.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Who's driving the boat?
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
Where...?
Have you ever had one do this?
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
No. Home here.
Do I need any more authority?
I didn't agree to that!
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Swell.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Florida license plate.
Be careful, for chrissake.
This is quite a place.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Set?
Twenty years.
So would I. Come on in.
Is that a boat?
He's busy.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
I don't have it.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
Well, I do.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
What?
No...
Huh?
Yeah. That was me.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Oh.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
Hey, I like this.
You don't have to do that.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Is Vanessa here?
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
What's the matter?
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Vanessa, right?
You found us in the Penny Saver?
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Room with a toilet, got it.
I went to the doctor today.
This is the baby. Your baby.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Thundercats are go!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
That is sick, man.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Share the love, Tits!
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
I suppose anything's possible.
Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
Karma.
...Yeah.
...Yeah, sure.
Could I try that?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Sure.
No it is not!
Do what?
...Anything else?
...That's not true.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
What do you need a Bible for?
Best kind.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
If you say so.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
What happened to Adele?
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
How do you know that?
I'm finished.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Not yet.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
No, never. Excuse me.
Wasn't my fault...
Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job.
Who are you?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Yes.
You fucked it?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Yeah.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
She won't? Why not?
I like you too.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
But I'm scared Telly.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Do you care about me?
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
No, Fidget, I...
Yeah.
I wouldn't believe it?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
What?
What?
What?
You're OK?
No.
Yeah?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
I didn't bleed.
I only did it once and...
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Whah you say? Dissdee?
It's like...
Yeah.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
But then I won't need your money.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
I don't know, eight or nine.
It's very monotonous.
To come?
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Yes.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
No.
How'd you get in here?
Homesearchers.
Sit down!
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
What was your relationship with her?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did anyone stand out?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Did you know her?
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
The police haven't told you?
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
I've figured out the message.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
The game's over.  You lost.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
No!  Wait!!
You don't understand.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
I just can't believe it.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Why did he what?
He was watching you.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
That has nothing to do with it.
For what?
Who's Kathy?
Six, eight hours tops.
That's great.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
What does that mean?
The most logical choice.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Ten days ago.
Through a rental agency.
We've already met.  Haven't we... Doctor.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
It doesn't make sense.
A building?
I went out.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
I want to be the best I can.
No.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
I don't think I could.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Let's change the subject.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Because I think he's wrong.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Then show me who you are.
Call room service.
What do you want on it?
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
Frank told me.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Thank you, but I can wait.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
All directions are the same here.
Does the Queen live?
I have no extraordinary powers.
But there is another entrance to this place.
You have rope?
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
I forbid you!
We must enter the swamp.
Saddles.
Yes. It is today.
Yes.
I cannot betray my bride.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
You and I will guard the fire.
How did you know I had sons?
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Hand over your dinner.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
At the gallop!
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Would you settle for a boar?
I am Quell.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
No.
A small house.
And mine goes with you.
I have a cinnamon bar.
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
It's right behind you.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
It is important to assure the succession.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Many have perished in that maze.
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power to kill.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
No.
No.
...What?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Do you need money?
Huh... 500 meters?
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
OK.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
What?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Mathilda?!
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
A little...
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Salute.
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
I have new dreams now.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
How serious is it?
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
It's just a regular day.
Yes.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Then why?
You like to take walks?
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
About my love for her.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Jumped where?
You tell stories?
By car right?
Yes.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
She knew you loved her.
What Mr. Parker?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Saluting.
It's mine to risk.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Evening News?
It's yours.
What are my choices?
...Noooo.
No.
No.
Hello.
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
No -- S.E.R.A.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't be silly?
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
When?
We?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
How much, do you think?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Yuri... are you...
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
I can't tell you.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Who could better understand than me?
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Yes.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Tell him, Paulette.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
Yes, I am.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
I'm so happy for you!
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
Really?
You guys are so sweet!
You think?
Your scrunchie?
Power yoga?
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Thanks again for your help!
I wasn't gonna --
No, she can't move for an hour.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
For a butt-head? Yes.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Oh, my God!!
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Where's Warner?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
No.
What, like it's that hard?
Thank you.
Three months.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
Not from me, surely...
I am afraid of nothing.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Oh, yes...
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
East of Mercia?
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
What does she want from me?
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Don't you care about what's happened?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Jack, don't!
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
The chill is worse this night.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Fire away!
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Can you save her?
I don't... understand.
Patience, lad.
Never show mercy!
He'll not escape me.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Where?
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
No, no, no... this is different!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Three cheers for our champion.
They've fired the moat!
Sorry.
Stop complaining.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Shhh!
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I don't want it on me.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Oh, la...
Then, perchance you'll me.
In the dark... where I join him...
And I... love you...
Lili... I love you!
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching me!
Everywhere!  Ow!
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Ask away, sweet man.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
Is she fair, this princess?
Dead, dead, dead.
You'll visit again?
And sweet?
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
And as barren of love as stone.
Heading north still?
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
Up ahead!
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
The Black Baron, you say?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
That very nice.
I thought I might stop by.
Sam!
Mom said I should.
What's wrong?
You'd better call and cancel.
Who are all these people?
No.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
He jumped into the ocean.
Really?
I don't want you to!
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
What are you talking about?
I'm not gay.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
If that's what it takes.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Maybe that's too long.
That's too long.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
What can I do for you, George?
Thank you.
Thank you.
My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
I'll get your bag.
You have everything?
Why?
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
Don't.  I don't want it.
He's got nothing to do with me.
I'm telling you now.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
Are you taking them still?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I haven't been touched in years.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
But you can't call me while you think?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
I dreamed about your house last night.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
My stupid back.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I'd rather you not be here.
Left you?
So could I.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Who?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Should I?
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
I know.
Sam took them to a movie.
Either do you.
No.
I just thought it would be nice.
Can we really help build a house?
Someone stop her!
Dad's home, already?
Nigger.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She got married last month.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Here!
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Good old Monroe.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
A loan officer?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Oooh...
What'd you say?
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Forget it.
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
The hell you talking about? What train?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
What am I gonna eat?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Whatever.
Make 'em throw strikes.
That was five years ago.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
I'm not working on a plan.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
I said you're soft.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
You killed Santa Claus?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Made just for you, Cookie.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Rayford!
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Satchmo.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
What do you think about... Earth?
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
I think you're looking at him.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
You did it for Namath.
Son, just do your best.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
Beast.
What was it called, sir.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Oh, would you grow up.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
'Bout time...
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
That way.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You keep a bat under your seat?
You smell like coconuts.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
"Octopus people?"
Basically, yeah.
What was that?
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
From my dad's side of the family.
I don't know?
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Please... No.
No.  Just no.
He was killed.
Jessica.
I'm afraid to tell you.
K.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
Of course --
But what is this -- why?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I doubt it.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Of course.
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
No.
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
What makes you think so?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
They're comin' with us.
What?
Yeah.
What is?
Maid? Relative?
Yeah.
Yeah... Laurent.
You know what I think?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Andy?
Why are ya goin' so early?
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Yes, I believe so.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Yeah? what did they want?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
What's the word on the street?
No, sir, it's not.
What about yesterday?
He won't give his name.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
Not even close.
A headache?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
The first night... Not the last two.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No, nothing.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
But...
Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I can see that.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Sorry... I...
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Sure. Sure I do.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Come on.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Oh, really?
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Yes.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Nothing. Why?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Well - I'm—
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Centuries.
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
You're startled?
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Suppose she should leave it?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
No.
Pardon me—
Father Perrault is dead.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
You?
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Yes.
It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Is that all my story meant to you?
She's going with me.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Where are we going? Huh?
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I wonder.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Bump?
You see, it's not a dream.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
All right, I'll be there.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
We're the government, Cowan.
Kay, I'm sorry...
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Sir--
What?
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
So what's the problem?
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Why?
Let's check am out.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
We're rising.
The Pentagon.
Kay.  All I'm saying--
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Actually... I don't know.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
No.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Nothing.
Yeah, Kay?
Wait-- listen--
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Can you see?
Is it now?
He'll turn around.
Wait.
What is it?
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
She died?
Then who was he?
It's all I could safely move.
I can't even stand up --
Hang on, Lamar --
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
What?
I'm fine.
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Everybody runs.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Georgetown.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
You gonna tell on me?
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
I need your help.
They don't belong to anybody.
I guess that's all of it.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
You gotta have faith, Dad.
Wanna hear something funny?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
The precogs were wrong.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
The what?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Not if I stay away from him.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
The safest place of all.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
The female.
He's dead, Lara.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
We know why John was tagged.
Sean --
Lamar --
Tell him not now.
Not.  Now.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Wait, just a second...
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
Not quite.
I don't understand --
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Yes, I know.
There's thousands of units like this one.
How many?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
I know who you are.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
To what?  Trap him?
What are you talking about?
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
He's alright.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
No more.
Bullshit.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
Chloe?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
There's no touching.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
They were out of line --
Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
What is it?
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
Good morning.
Nah, man...
Where's the drop?
No. That's cool, man.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Ricky's taken care of.
Ruiz isn't here.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I know the number.
Then why do you try to get in?
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
You sure?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Forty-six.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
I told you what they said.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
We're getting whacked.
C'mon, man...
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
We don't need guns.
It was six in the fucking morning.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
No more, man.
Let's just go now and wait.
I don't want to take any more chances.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Bobby and Ricky.
The line's over there.
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
S'up.
Cool. See you later.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Where do you live?
'Strapped?'
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
You're from LA, right?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
I'll take your goddam bet.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Elijah who?
That's what Mama used to say.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Who are you?
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
No, Brother Minister.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
What?
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
I can handle it.
You have enough worries of your own.
Why do you ask?
How old are you, Betty?
I know.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Because you're in trouble.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Dear heart, I love you.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
What did I tell you about assuming?
Is my family here yet?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
That's right.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Please, go ahead.
Entirely.
Yes, sir, I did.
What?
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
If she got eyes, she do.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
You hear me, girl?
What's your story, baby?
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Eat lead, coppers.
Tell him about Baldy.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Allah will provide.
He's bright.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
I don't know shit about you.
So you are going to talk me to death.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[South America.]
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
It's a little late.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Daniel what?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who ordered it?]
[I believe you.]
[I want you.]
[Her life for your life.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[Don't lie to me!]
It's loaded.
I drink.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
What do you mean, I'm here?
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
Different door. Not far from here.
Who's Emilio?
The United States.
I'm a bargain.
That's right.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
You need to practice.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
Yes.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
No.
Could I stop you?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
Dyslexic?
Never.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
She understands men.
[No. Why?]
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Our daughter.
I already ate.
Two tourists who never went home.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
Well, it ain't your baby.
What happen?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Who?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Yes, I know.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Please...
Please...
How do you do?
We just live one flight up.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
I'll see you around.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Tomatoes.
Marty...
Put on your blue suit...
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
I don't know. I don't think so.
She didn't look Italian to me.
What didn't you like about her?
Hey, Ang'...
This is a good deal here, Marty.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
I'm gonna see you tonight...
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
How you, Radar?
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Back home.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Look at that right eye.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
I don't drink intoxicants.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
Perfectionist.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
He can't take much more time on the table.
We been had.
Sixteen times.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Be right with you.
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Oh, Jesus.
What do we do?
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Not necessarily.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
I didn't mean with me.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Let's get his clothes off quick.
There's only one worth noticing.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
I don't think so either.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
You mean who hit who?
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Damn.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Good morning.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah, maybe.
Are you all right?
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Against what?
Who?
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
No.
About me?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
Money.
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The Websters.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Wait a minute . . .
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
There is no letter.
So?
Sorry.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
That's—
Did you find her?
Go out and find her!
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Both of 'em?
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
The heelots!
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Sure. Mostly often.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
John Doe Club?
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Did you want to see her about something important?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
No, sir.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
You're my hero.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
What happened, Mike.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
They want Walter dead!
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
...a car.
Being faxed over now.
Roper...
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Yep.
I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
Like it had to be done.
National Marksman Competition.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
Not the ones I'm at.
You living together?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Okay, stop.
That's okay. That's his style.
The jockey!
About six years. My partner took me.
He's cutting down the visibility.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Pull up alongside.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
So what do you want to do?
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
You worship yourself.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Scottie...
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
It's okay. We broke up.
Just now.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
And you think he'll...
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
A deeper level?
Prude.
Depends. What's up?
Your concern is heartwarming.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
Wake up?!
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
Who?
Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
Good question.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Her?
Realize?
Yes.
This.  No point to it.
Because you'll never believe me.
Just like that?
Resurrection.
Checking connection.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
What does that mean?!
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
... I just pray we're not too late.
We can take these guys!
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
There's enough for everybody!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
A real shame.
BULK!!
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
You want me to place a few calls?
How'd you know?
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
Strength in numbers!!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Charlie Luciano.
Tell me about it.
No. Not everything.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
That ain't what your mama said.
I can just imagine.
It's a mask.
London?
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
So what is the problem?
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
No. We ain't even...
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Come off it, Bugs.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
You gotta plan these things.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
But that's an hour's drive.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
What about the share.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
We were overdue to get hit.
And what do you want out of this?
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
If it comes to that. Yeah.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
That a Jew compliment?
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
I don't know. I guess it was...
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Sad commentary, huh?
Thank me next time you see me.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Why?
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
Who?
I don't think so.
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
The ring...
Give me a date, Doctor.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
What?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Aaron?
I can make my own decisions.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
Yeah.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine-- call Saunders--
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Would you settle for a husband?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
What do I play?
Yeah.
Tonight?
Have *you*?
What?
What?
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Okay--I mean--
Right now--everything I own--!
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Ma! Hold him!
Uh--could--could I help--?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Look! There it is!
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Will he yield for a question?
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
Jefferson--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
You're a liar!
The man downstairs said number--
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
You *couldn't*?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
And with your help--
Why?
Calendar?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Try sitting down.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
No.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Have I?
Go right ahead.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
It *is* not!
No!
In Terry Canyon?
No--
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Don't mention it--
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Wait--
Oh--Saunders--
Wonderful!
Splendid.
I'm splendid, too.
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Well--I can *manage*--
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Do you?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Senator Paine.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Sometimes he whistles.
Yes, you own it.
Yes, indeedy.
No!
Yes!
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Uh-huh.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
No, I don't mind.
No. It's nothing.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
Hello.
Uh-huh.
Had the boys follow us.
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Yes.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Shhh!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Me, sir?
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Let me go!
Better wire him right away, John.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
This is outrageous!
Mr. Cedar!
Wants to know who the heir is.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
How do you do.
Yes.
No, thank you.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Well, I play the tuba.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Oh, the poet? Where?
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Now you keep out of this!
South Dakota - but on the top.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Yes, sir.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
What's that?
Looking for?
You try it.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
How did they threaten you?
Really? You think so?
Take your time.
Mr. Cook.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
No, not really.
...And I from Phyllis.
Right now?
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
I don't want to hear any more today.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
And the experiment is in here?
My pleasure.
Nope.
What do you do?
You've done well.
Yes, your honor.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
He told you.
Okay.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
Sure.
Martin.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Hmm.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Is she against you getting help?
Something's bothering her.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
That's... good?
Which show was that?
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
True. Should we stop them?
Uh-huh.
Do you think that's what he wants?
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Good-looking woman.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
Yep.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Jerking off?
Just you.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
You were messed up, man.
Things got a lot worse.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
What'd I do?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Yes, yes it does...
Yep.
When?
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
You're not going to kill us?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
And then killing your sister.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
What friend? You're my only friend.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Perhaps.
What is he doing here?
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Twenty.
What did you find? What did you see?
Want to know?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
The things that get you excited.
Preparation for what?
How?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
And what is that?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Picked his pocket, actually.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Still...
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Um, well, you see...
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
I know you did.
Except for one little thing.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
He was cute though.
I can't.
Sure.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Get on to yourself!
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
You're nuts.
You're a spy.
Not tonight. 
Alone tonight?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
It's home.
Monica, where are you?
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
And what if you get killed?
Monica!
I just know.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
When are you going to take off that mask?
My heart died a long time ago.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Yeah.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
But there's still only six of us.
Because that's what it is.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
I can't.
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Come on.
Anybody got any?
Not yet.
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Ow.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
But... the silverware?
Definitely.
This looks like a job for Superman --
Shut up.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
Whatever our name is.
But how do we get in?
It's suicide.
With or without him, we gotta go!
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
May I come to the map?
What do you have in mind?
Cavalry?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
Let me see it.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Ajaccio.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
I see...
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
What is that?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Lisette La Croix.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
No.
I don't understand you.
I know what you're doing in there.
Five minutes.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
Yes, I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
God help me -- yes.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
Of course, my dear.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Does she deserve anything better?
Yes, he has.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Anything you need.
That's it?
Alright, I'll remember that.
Don't move me.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
What happen?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
I can't taste nothing.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
What you mean, so?
You walked?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
You already in.
Ain't no windows in here.
Out the door and to the left.
Nothing.
I didn't see nothing.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
What about me?
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't know.
I said hold on!
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
I do.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Come on.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
What up, bro?
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
You damn right that's the big one.
Negative...they vamped.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.
Call me.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
I don't know, Debo.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
I got my mase.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
That's my girl.
San Diego.
Sorry.
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
Indeed.
I would also like to apologize.
For not believing you.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
What's your point?
Where did you get these? Who are you?
No, please...
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
On TV.
Nods.
No, kisses to...
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
I don't know.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Help me get her off the rug.
Where?
'Daddy has to go now.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
Dad, you're bleeding...
Yes, Dad.
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
How's your sister Pearl?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Mister Powell!
You better not sing that song.
'Cause you're too little.
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
John, where are we g --
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Is that all?
Nothin'!
No. No.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I don't know nothin'!
Don't you believe me?
What secret shall I tell?
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Because John said I mustn't.
I -- no, I --
I'm through, Harry.
How'do.
The Drugstore?
Now who was this?
Pearl and John.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Uh-oh...
Okay, okay.  I think.
You do?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Okay. Hi, dad.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
What?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
I don't mean her --
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Krueger.
I will.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Nancy?
S'curity.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
So he's alive?
Just sleep now, Mom.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
No.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
About what?
I have nothing to hide.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Just for the honeymoon.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
No, no.
I must be stern with you.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
I don't feel like any breakfast.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
No, sir.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Get out of here!
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
No, no.
Comrade.
A day.
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
We did our best, Comrade.
Well, we're back home.
Even the swallows are back.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Gladly.
How long does it take a man to land?
Go ahead.
Please don't misunderstand me...
Yes.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Ni-notchka.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
No, that was restful. Again.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
You know I want to...
What are you after?
Then you should go back to your table.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Yes.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
My darling.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
What, darling?
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Yes... a little white house.
All right, we'll make it red.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Much happier.
But I can throw it out of the window.
Good morning, Swana.
Oh, yes.
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Huh?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
I must insist that you leave.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
Thank you.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Where do you eat?
Where is it?
My jewels?!
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
So ... let's go ...
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
You do it.
'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when you get it from someone you trust.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
... go on.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
Cox!  Fire him.
That's right ...
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
What's Liddy got?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
"Security" is not strong enough.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
All right.
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
Money.  Follow the money.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
How?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Sir ... six bodies.
Yes, Mother ...
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
My friends call me "Mister President."
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
Yes.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
Winning?
How about you?  Are you going to win?
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
I won't tell him if you won't.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Yes, Mr. President.
Did you cry when he died?
Why?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
Syracuse.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
I like jazz ...
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
The hell with 'em.
Sir?
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
Do you really want this, Dick?
They're all your enemies?
You personally?
When?
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
Thank you.
They were for me.  They're mine.
Lost.
To what?
The "crises"?
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
Whatcha mean by that?
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
Most don't.
No ID in her room?
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
That's very linear Sheriff.
I don't know...
No. Probably I don't.
Sheriff?
I'm ahead of you there.
I don't know. He ought to...
Natural to the line of work they was in.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
That's very nice.
I never do.
Okay.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
What? Quit hollerin'.
Goin' out.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Well -- how come?
I shall return.
You know what's goin' on?
What makes you say that?
She'll be all right.
I know something better.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Screwgie.
Yeah? Where am I?
You know she won't be there.
Yes.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Sir?
You married into it.
Everything.
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Uh-huh.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
Let's just call it square.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
That's not an answer.
What else then?
How would you describe him?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
I didn't say braze.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
No sir.
Yes sir.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
No, I didn't have to.
What about it?
"Banners?"
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
Yeah, me too.
All the time...
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
Didn't I?
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
What's so special about it?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
What?
I came for love...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
I'll go to the Hospital.
He has no heartbeat!
The one you were telling me about?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Who?
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
...okay.
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Ahh... my wife's.
Of what?
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
I... I don't know...
Beer, please.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Should I kill him now?
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
...who doesn't?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
It is, if you like idiots...
"Injuns?"
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
I don't know, George...
I SAID FORGET IT!
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
I swear to God!
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Do not seek the treasure!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Where's Tommy?
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
Okay, Pappy.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
You said -
The hell you say! Wash is kin!
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
It was in his bureau.
Isn't it, uh...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Blooey!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
He's a suitor!
Buyin' nipples!
Yes, Sir.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
I joined the Navy.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Why? Because you can do it alone?
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Yes, sir!
No, sir.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Yeah.
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
What?
One more minute.
Everything was different.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
You hope.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No. I never feel like that.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
He didn't give you much choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Any time, sailor.
I'll get it if you want.
What's stopping you?
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Why'd he do it?
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Yeah. All week long.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Naw.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Peace out.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
I have the gun.
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
I can't...
Are you gonna open the safe?
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
This was your department, Junior.
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Pure idiot.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
I did.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Yeah, whatever.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
It's just the woman and the kid?
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
The crowd goes wild.
It doesn't work?!
Wait.
Feel okay?
Say fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
I'm here.  I'm here.
"Titanic."
He won't even know who it was.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
I have confirmed to you my address, that's all I'm required to by law to do. We have broken no law.
Yeah.
I got you.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
No man. PE -- "political education."
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
No man. Gonna walk.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Nothing.
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
Where is he?.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Late summer.
Thank you.
You call that a compliment?
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Pride will do.
As do you.
You couldn't have known.
Goodbye.
Yes, sir.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Prisoner exchange.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Not yet.  What happened?
He tried.  It didn't take.
Yes, sir.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
I don't care.  I hate him.
That's five, keep going...
I'm sorry.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Long time.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
How many men have we seen die?
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Worse.
Quiet.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Well...I guess not.
Is that right, dad?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
For a little while.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
That's enough, Ellen.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
I think it is so, Ellie.
I don't know.
Then come on.
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Wendigo?
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
Remember.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
Yes, I guess I do.
You're doing fine.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
She.  Goes.  Free.
Elizabeth goes free!
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
Aye, for us there is.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Can I trust you?
Then why aren't you eating?
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Yes -- yes.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Nor did you, I noticed.
Exactly.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
Pirate.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
How?  The key's run off.
Good.
Aye!  Avast!
That's not true.
Depends.
I'll lead them away.
Yes.
Yes, I have.
A moment.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
No.
No, thank you.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Ain't it.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Nebbleman.
Why are there two ottomans?
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Considering what?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
Aaabout...?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Who isn't?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
The big house?
Yeah, we'll see.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Mouse?  What mouse?
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
That was 'simple'?
No, why?
What?  What's wrong?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
No problem.
What did you want my hair for?
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Where is it?
Let's go.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
The same thing I suppose.
I remember I was trying to help...
We were different people then.
I guess they do.
It's a miracle.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Yes, he might be.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
No - give you another guess.
So, it's obvious, huh?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Of course I am Stewart.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Gallagher?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Thanks, I will.
Well, I should say!
Is that so?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Yeah?
With me you can always do business.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
Yes, sir.
A what?
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Yes - and I'd love it.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Sorry, boss—
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
I have it here.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
She did—?
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Sure.
Double strength!
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
All right, Grandma—
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
The name is Smythe.
Now the lady said you may go—
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Me, sir?
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
What do you mean?
It can't be possible.
No ... They won't be able to tell.
What?
I'm sorry ...
Bud brought it to me.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
... Lover's Lane.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Why not?
With what?
Oh, no thanks ...
"Changes."
Thank you very much.
Yes I did.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Well--it was dark out ...
Okay--that's enough!
Why am I out of order?
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
What?
The other one?
No way.
Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
I don't know.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
What were you doing in a library?
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Nothing.
Really? It seems so fattening.
That's great.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
What?
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
... Lover's Lane?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Yeah ... Sort of ...
Because we don't belong!
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
No you're not.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Just gimme the damn remote!
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Just listen to me ...
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Hey.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
D&D Mattress Man.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Hello everyone.
I have work, I can't leave.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna call you back.
It's fine, but --
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
I just want to know where she's staying.
I'm in my bedroom.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
Where is she?
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
You're going to work now?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Really? Please?
....what....?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I didn't lie.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
They don't get opened until eight.
I don't know.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Hi.
Yes I do.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Ok.
Sure.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
About six months.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Yes? I'm trying.
If you come to Hawaii --
Yes.
yeah.
This is nice.
What is this?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
For what?
Ok, bye, bye.
Why?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
What's that for?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
That's that.
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
Fine, thank you.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
....yes.....
You should go on a trip.
Where you goin?
Hi.
Wait a minute --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
What do you have in the house?
Is this where you live?
Are you going to the party tonight?
What time are you gonna be there?
Seriously.
You can't just stay in your house.
I'll see you there.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Are you sure?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Sorry.
No.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Not now, or we're both done for.
"Turn you out?"
Mustn't do that, sir.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
You among them?
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Was it impotence?
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
Oh indeed?
Of course.
What could cause a tincture like this?
Poorly.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
Don't start --
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
I am not a wealthy woman.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
My name is Orson Welles
To make pictures.
Do you?
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Randolph!
There's no call for that language-
I wanted it
Not for me.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Huh?
We're using-
Nonsense
Showing life
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Orson, please ... it's too bright
Please don't say this.
Don't do this
Listen to me-
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
But it's not a great syllable
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
I don't give a shit about-
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
Christ.
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Herman.
Yes.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Get out.
Again.
Again
It's just that my movie is so-
It was a -joke, George
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I don't want to sit
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
I'm Christ
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
How can he embarrass you?
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Where's your wife, Jake?
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Yeah, she's nice.
You wasn't with her?
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Whatsa matter with you?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Does that mean...
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Come over here.
Come here.
Yeah, what?
What did I say?
I went to the movies.
"Father of the Bride."
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
What're you talking about?
You did?
Yeah --
I'm leaving you Jake.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
What friends?
He should.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
I'll bet it's been done.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Give him evidence.
You think he's getting out of here?
All the things I hate.
A possibility.
Like an old hambone?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
With that cast on -- you don't.
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
I don't know what you mean.
It crashed, didn't it?
Lisa Fremont.
I'm not ready for marriage.
She's all right.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
She pay you much?
And some man will lose his.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Uh-huh.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How much do you think you'll need?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
I wish there was one I wanted.
For what?
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Tell me about it.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What's the apartment house number?
To get on home.
Someone not his wife?
I don't know.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Who was the trunk addressed to?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Thank you.
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
How?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Good luck, Buzz.
Somebody find him a knife.
Yeah.
Smashed the front door.
Down in back.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
Hang loose.  We got all night.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
You make any sandwiches?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
Well--
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
I don't want to learn that!
Have some cigars.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
That's right!
What's that pounding?
Yes, sir.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Well maybe she better start.
Plato.
In my mother's drawer.
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
I know.  That's why I came back.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
They're still there!
Judy.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
I've got a gun.
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
My gun?
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
Goodbye, dear.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
And your folks didn't understand?
What?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
I'm not so bad.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
There's just one thing.  What about--
I don't know.
You don't need to do that.
You disappointed?
He hates me.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
You said you'd call my father.
We were romantic then too--
No.  Why?
Hi.
I didn't want to stop.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
YES!!!
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
Radio said.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
NICK!
What the fuck is going on.
You're in on this.
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
They're truck drivers.
Don't say my name...
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
Who wouldn't.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Yes!
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
Samantha.
Her brother.
Hey.
I said, who the hell made the map?
And I worked there. For a year.
More than you know.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
I'm no threat without a gun.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
How'd you know my name...
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
What... Powwow...
OPEN IT!!!
What?
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
How do we do that?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
I promise you, I didn't know!
Haven't thought about it.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
I'm just saying.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
YOU TELL HER!
She set them up. All of them.
What? No...
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
Elois?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
This better not be some Freddy joke.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
It's a change.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
What do you care?
Give me my book.
Sorry, it's my book now.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
That's your proof?
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
You didn't ask.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Joe.
I can' take you to a hospital.
I don't believe in it.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
A few cops.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Where?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
For all I know, you're the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I think he's just passed out.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
He asked.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
That fuckin did it!
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
There's a slight difference.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Look of things, she doesn't.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
You can stay here if you like.
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Yeah.
He's learning his letters.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye, Mary.
Why?
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
Which ranch?
A man I used to know.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
And meet him there.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Good thing you didn't.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
I don't care what she asked you.
Nobody asked you to.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
I like it.
There aren't any women here.
Yeah.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
How many ways can a man say no.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
What for?
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Put on another one.
Lookin' around.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
No. We're not stayin' --
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
You were supposed to be reading words.
But you're his brother.
Oh, sure.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Would you die already?!
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
Hey, I have an idea...
Okay.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Shhh!
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Hugh Kane.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Can you feel that?
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Then what are we going to do?
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I don't care. You pick.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
It's the sequel.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
We have to destroy him.
My child, you're alive!
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I wouldn't go that far.
Who?
Saw who?!
Any of them hot?
What's this?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
What is it, Dwight?
Hi.
And sexy.
That's right.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Because she will lie?
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
It says, "Ray."
Get out?! What does it say?
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
You said you hated him.
MURDERED?!!
I don't feel like rewinding it!
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
Let me see!
This is so silly. 
You mean for TV or print?
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!
We can be real quiet...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
I certainly did.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
It's sugarless.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Yes... but... I didn't...
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Sure I do.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Drink.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
She can only use cash.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Hello, Frances.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
I did her hair.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
Yes.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
I don't know.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Not from me.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
I'm afraid.
Why wait?
Good-bye.
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I have something even better.
I don't know.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
Uh—huh.
Tell me what?
Perhaps
It might have.
I'd like that.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
I never thought you did.
I'm afraid not.
Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
I know this is difficult for you. I know that you love her.
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Television?
No. Why?
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Kids? What about them?
Nothing I can't finish later.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I'm sorry this came up.
Maybe you want to go.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Yes.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
No.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
How come?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I'm not in love with you.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
No.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
No.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Always the lawyer.
You've made your point.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
Yes.
Yes.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Do you have to say that?
But he won't.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
But why did you want to?
You don't know that for sure.
Did he touch you?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
You are in serious trouble.
Hold on.
Well. I can't stay.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
When I was fourteen.
He said that my hand felt good.
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
Is that what he tells you?
No? Not even one more?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
What's so stupid about it?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
I just... Ann is very...
Look, are we going to do it or not?
God, you... you're mean.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
It'll just be me.
What do you mean?
I like having the car, the car is important.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
No.
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
All right, jesus.
Was he nice to you?
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Yes.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
OK. But late.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Nick, you're so strange...
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
We live in 703.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
Did I say anything?
It's crazy.
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
NIGHT NIGHT
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
Fools!
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Dentonvale has been sold.
Who trusts experts?
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
He was a President.
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
Of course.
Who?
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I'm sorry, Officer.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Do you really think so?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Gary.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
What are you pouring tonight?
Bottle.
I'm good.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
You said you had it all lined up.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Oh yeah. Much better.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
You know that chick?
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I'm a quick learner.
You have the keys.
What?
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
I'm fine!
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Yep.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Understanding of what?
Yeah.
Is what the money thing?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
What exactly are we going to do?
You have to tell me --
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
I know what you need.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
No, I'm okay.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Whatever. Sorry.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
Twelve months in oak.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
That's what I'm having.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Yeah.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
I guess.
I'm pregnant.
Both.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
It tastes funny.
That's weird.
Who said I was going to die?
I don't feel much.
...I will.
Curse and stuff.
Are you going to do this or what?
I heard.
Yes it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
That's right.
Yes.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Ray Reddy's house.
Me too.
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Me too.
Yes.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
There are none.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
I would say so.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Pinned? What does that mean?
What book!
No money, eh?
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
McKendrick.
Where's Jake?
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Yeah... that must have been it.
Ten A.M.
No, Leavenworth.
I've got a job.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
All I did was kiss the girl.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Why would they stop you?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Good luck, Mal.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
I heard that too.
I just got to town.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Give me some of the good stuff.
What do you mean?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I am telling the truth.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
Please.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
I'll send you her resume.
What about it?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
Viktor, you should have said something.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Excuse me?  Start?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
When is she coming over?
Impossible.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
Not if I don't let her.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
No... it's life.
Because obviously she existed, right?
Well, I --
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Do what you do to Simone.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
You never were together, Hal.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
Why not?
How did the wall get there?
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I need flesh and --
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
You do?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
I read.
Precisely.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I love you too, daddy.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
What do you want -- ?
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
-- What you don't understand --
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Congratulations.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Yeah. Sorry.
What?
I forgot myself.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Never mind.
I don't know, Cole.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Maybe.
...I don't know.
Got it.
What?
You're a stuttering Stanley!
Meaning?
Not according to these.
Someone actually... employs you?
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Manure... is life.
Harvest moonshining!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
-- It's not me!
Not while you're driving.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Who? Us?!
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Amen.
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Yeah?
About what?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
Mmmm -- so can I...
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Us? We been... moonlighting.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Grant.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Aspirin.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Yeah.
Shut up.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
All the rib eyes?
That's disrespectful.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Last year, this was a new rig.
What do you think?
A what?
Okay.
Having fun.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Eleven.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Ciao.
You could've asked.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
Ummm?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
That man is your father?!?
You gotta admire the man's determination.
That's me.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Running blocker.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Can a pig whistle?
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
We'll be waiting. Over.
I'm cucumber cool.
About one to five years worth.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Who's Fred?
Maybe.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Ww... uh...
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
I thought Heller was a double op?
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
...He does now...
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
-- okay, g'head --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
...What are they doin' right now...?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
What do you want?
Can it work?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Yes.
He's dead.
That depends.
Shut up.
My wife.
To who?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
I'll be right back.
To calm your anxiety.
Yes.
I want you inside me right now.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
Yes.  Yes.
Do you?
Rheya --
Neither did I.
I want you here.
Yes, you are --
Am I really her?
Why do you say that?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
There's a phone in the car.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Yeah.
Sooner, the better.
Hmm...
They're kind of fuzzy.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
And "is"...?
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
Tell it like it is.
Sleep good.
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
I don't know.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I know.
"To"... Forget about you.
Yeah...
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
What?
Your what...?
Get in bed.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Why?
It's not your taste.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
She bought it.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
No.
I'm all right.
Me neither.
I heard.
It should've been me...
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
Does it make you... hard?
No, sir...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
I'll prove it!
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
What the fuck you doin'?!
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting?
No. No, that's okay.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Remember Little League?
See?
Harry…
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Right.
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
Mr. Jameson--
Mr. Jameson--
Frmpph-yrr.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Even if they're not clever.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Thank God.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
That's the understatement of the year.
It'll shut itself off.
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
It's fine.  Tell me what--
How is he?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
No!
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Phooey on that.
Plenty.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
That'll do.
So long, Sefton.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
You stink, Sefton!
That's right.
And maybe a little something else?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
I'll call the whole pot.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Abfuehren!
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
Me? What if she don't want me?
Where'd that come from?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
She'll never forgive me!
Animal! Got a little something for you!
Let me alone.
Why, sure!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Anything else?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
A little weak today.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
You starting that again?
You did!
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Just what makes you so popular?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
Thirty-fifth.
Are you questioning me?
What did you say?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Shut up!  Security Officer, eh? Screening everybody, only who screened you? Great American hero. From Cleveland, Ohio! Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor! When was Pearl Harbor, Price? Or, don't you know?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Give me the radio.
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
HoS qorDu. 
He is.
Full disruptors.
Thanks for pointing that out.
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
When is it expected back?
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
All of us.
Yes, where would you go?
Oh, of course.
Yes, yes, it is.
You could say that.
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
No. Thank you.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Aye, sir.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
What is it?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
... Or <u>who</u>.
Spock's burial robe.
Logic indicates that is the case.
That may be difficult...
Not exactly.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
... How long?
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Goodbye, David.
Much is at stake...
Yes. And I know you.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
... A cloaking device?
What about surface life signs...?
Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.

You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!

... The needs of the few...
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Steady. Continue on impulse power.

I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
How is that...?
All true.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
That's all you have to say?
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
Thank you.
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Ah.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Is that a poem?
I know, I know...
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
You know what she'll say...
<u>This is Ceti Alpha V</u>! Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months after we were left here. The shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>Admiral</u> Kirk never bothered to check on our progress. It was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! On earth, two hundred years ago, I was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like Prometheus I have been left by Admiral Kirk to digest my own entrails.
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
What?
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
A few shots, sir.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Scotty, let's have it.
We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
The word is given: warp speed.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
The power of creation --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Steady as you go...
Uhura, patch me in --
The ship -- out of danger?
Or the one.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Yes, sir.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Engage warp engines --
Scotty!
Try again.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Aye, sir.
Never, sir.
By the book...
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Just a couple of kooks...
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Please...
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
We've done it before.
-- That's the general idea.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
... My God...
... Best shot...?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
You play games with me and you're through
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
Why's that?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
What's what?
Who do you think I am?
You want the details?
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Ah... The giants.
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
I see.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Aye, sir!
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
About 60 feet, Admiral.
On my way...!
No power to the bay doors.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
... Yes?
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
I thought it might begin the healing process.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
I don't know.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
A planet in Federation space...
The Ba'ku.
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
May I talk to you alone?
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
If it works you mean.
Why not?
On screen.
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
You've not aged a day since then?
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Make it so.
Beam him out!
Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him...
No, sir...
Picard to Crusher...
We have to find shelter...
You should feel right at home with them.
What...?
No children?
Or you could try lying down.
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
Activating injector assembly.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
I do not know what you are referring to.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I told you, there's no --
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
Understood. Keep me informed.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
<U>Engage.</U>
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
One minute to warp threshold...
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes.
Something wrong with that?
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Aye, sir.
Onscreen.
We're still in Earth orbit.
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
Yes, sir.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
What are you suggesting?
Commander... we have a problem.
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Now there's a poser.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
We were until your torpedoes!
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I'm not sure how to take that.
I am.
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Shields up. Battle stations.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
There's a reward for your death.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
So, that's it..
What peace conference?
Why would they give them to us?
Faith...?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
I don't want to.
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
What is it?
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
What exactly does that mean?
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
Not tonight, I have work here.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Now, you make a toast.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Sorry, sir.
It would appear so.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Fire!
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
Of you?
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
Divert power and compensate.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
Why is it moving?
With pleasure, Captain.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
How could I not?
No!
This isn't real.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
Understood.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
He wants to look me in the eye.
Just lucky, Admiral.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
On screen.
On screen.
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
She's a predator.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
We can only hope so.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
No?
What happened?
You'll acquire a taste for it.
How did you end up on Remus?
I have no reason to.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
Why am I here?
You're not Reman.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
He's a very unusual android.
Should I raise shields?
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
They're holding position.
None.

There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Thank you.
I understand.
I make maps.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Stay right there...
About five miles back.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
Oh shit!!!
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
Shermin...
You're not hearing me.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
This is George Fox...
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Watch it. They're coming out.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Which way do you want to go?
What.
Ah no.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
No gas.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Shit?
You. Mouth closed.
No.
You better.
Do you have a baby?
Why?
Go?
Goodbye.
Yes?
I was afraid.
I don't understand 'friend.'
He will.
Where did you learn that?
You promised.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Horses.
I gave you a baby last night.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
Yes.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
No, thank you.
I must go.
I will.
Call the police!!
In the cars, too?!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
I did.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
No.
Wait'll you see it.
Was there visual contact?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
You saw that?
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Leave him alone, Tran.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
No, Lenny.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Yeah.  No, not really.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
But this is a bad one.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
Only way I could stand your ties.
What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Naawww.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Your sex life?
You'll see.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Black.  Jack.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Fire's out, isn't it?
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
You never told me.
A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Take the tape to the cops.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
Um... he was older.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
That's right, Jan.
This isn't in our database?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
What?
Winona.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Hi. What's in the case?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Put a BOLO out on that.
What about his killer?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
This better be important.
Who?
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Then why do I still have a badge?
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
I don't believe this.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I didn't use Low's name.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
What did you tell him?
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
Oh.
Not the way I can.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
Does one exist?
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
The little piggie speaks.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
I already have an employer.
Those were just fantasies.
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
What did you do to end up here?
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
The same.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
Shut up.
You're money, baby.
What do you drive?
What kind of car do you drive?
...maybe...
Yeah.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Anything.
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
No matter what... like splitting aces.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
I understand.
Yeah. And an actor.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Hi, Mike?
I can call back...
Yeah?
Really?
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
What do you want? You're tall.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Well, let's hit that party.
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
No. Just O.J.
What's the point?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
Sure.
Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
Make someone bleed.
...He's derivative...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
S'up Trent?
I don't know...
You're crazy.
I'm not going to Vegas.
Vegas!
You think they're watching?
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Did she, or did she not smile.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
We didn't do so bad after all.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Yes!
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Michelle went for you, right.
It's on.
No, baby!
...Is he brown?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
You think?
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's definitely on.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
America has been good to me...
I'll come to you when I need you.
Barzini.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
I'm not hungry yet.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
OK, but be careful.
How bad will it be?
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
What percentages for my family?
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
Maybe I can help.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
For killing a man.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
How did you find out?
I'll need him.
Yes.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
We're all tired...
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Yes.  Tell me.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Sure.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Huh?
Please say it.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Cut it out.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Maybe.
I do renounce them.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You're unlucky.
Do you recognize my voice?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Well, we ate everything without you.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Is that good?
No, I like him.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Yes please!
Okay.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
What? What's this?
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
What?
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
I played piano in a few places.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Copy out from here...
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
No!
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
What club?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
What?
Sure.
What are you doing?
It's Freddie. Let me in.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
What's going on?
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
I'm fine.
What about Cortina?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
What does that mean?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
Get on. I'll take you to him.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I don't believe you.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
Do you know Tom?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Randall.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
No key, huh?
I give up.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
That's an expensive gun.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
I bought a couple of tickets.
What's wrong?
Hello, Betsy.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
More people watch it.
What is it? I'm busy.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
What did you do?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I don't like my real name.
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
You can do it in my mouth.
I can leave anytime I want.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
Huh?
He shoots dope too.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
Do I look like a narc?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Cops don't do nothin.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
Physical? Criminal?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Shit.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Iris?
Slow.
I know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
You suppose?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Wrong.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Partners.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Damn...
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Well...
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
And why not?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
I'm  fine.  Really.  
What?
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Oh.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
I do.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Who... are they?
Oh.  What... what time is it?
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
Yes.
Did you... did you...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Then I'll call you a cab.
Aren't you coming?
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Huh?
I... I don't believe this.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Luke didn't smoke.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
I taught you that.
No, I...
I thought you...
Yes?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
No, not really.
No. Just a few hours.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Lovebirds.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
All right. 
Where are you from originally, Annie?
How'd you happen to come here?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Cathy!
Take them.
Right across the bay there.
Mmmm.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Okay.
Yep?
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
What happened?
They're back!
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Yes, very.
I told you. We met yesterday.
Yes.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
I got them all, Mother.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
Oh, my God, look at her!
You're doing fine.
But they'll be back.
If they are?
I started to say... inside...
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
What?
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
I don't mind, really.
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Not by the thousands.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
That's all right.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Are they moulting now?
How can you tell?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
Yes?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Oh, yes.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Like what?
I'm glad you do.
No, tell me.
No, I have my things in the car.
Are you staying?
So they united.
Hear, hear!
With my little sparrow leading team.
After the gulls attacked.
Don't let's take any chances.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Maybe.
Almost two a.m.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
I have no idea.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Not if they're starting a war.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Then let's go. Now!
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Can't you please finish your drink?
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Good morning.
I want you to help my little girl.
Ask this one favor --
Aye.
MacFarlane
I've heard of it.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
I remember her.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Pulse?
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
I wanted to see the white horse --
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
You will not have it?
I am the best man for the job.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
I've drunk enough tonight.
I have other means of sustenance.
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
I know --
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
I'm looking for my friends.
You sent them. I had no choice.
You're wrong.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
How can you die if you're already dead?
No! Why are you haunting me?
Yes I do, I really do.
I know.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
You mean Alex.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Not tonight. Honest.
I want you... to bend over.
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
Honey. I just can't.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Looks like you have them both on.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Of course, dear.
What do you mean, dear?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
All right.
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Why not, Bobby?
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
About five months -- your months.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
You still haven't answered my question.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
Is that what you're thinking about?
I feel different right now.
Jittery is the word.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
May I see you for a minute?
What time is it?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
It won't work.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
Yes -- Just exactly.
I -- I thought you were--
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
Would you like to sell it?
I'd give you a very good price.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
You don't.
They would have killed this man?
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
You better get some fresh air.
He's my brother.
Time to activate Plan B.
Zero.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
They're gonna book us.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
Why?  They're only noodles.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
What happens in tow and a half hours?
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Okay, okay.
Sam, don't --
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Whatcha doin' over here?
Did we have a date tonight?
He's just a deep sleeper.
Michael!...
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
But, Mom...
Mom!
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Well, I...
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Take laddie.
Save Laddie first.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Nowhere.
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Don't turn on the light.
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
What about Mom?
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Let's load 'em.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Cool it, Palmer!!
Let go of me...
Hell no.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
Was dark... find a light...
That's good enough.
What?
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
What for?
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Come on, Copper.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Nothing we can do about that.
Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
That far?
What's that?
Don't let up, Childs!
I am going after them.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Damn if I won't.
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
We going to make it?
I ain't going with Sanchez.
I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Can you think of any other tests?
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
What for?
Hear what?
Can't hear you.
But you're only a mud carrier.
But there's nothing here.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Morlocks --
Can you show us where they live?
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Oh, shut up.
This is the way in?
Yes.
I don't understand.
I will...
Alexander.
Created?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
A man can change his history.
No...
I -- what are you?!
Why is it -- breaking up?
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
A moonstone.
No... let's walk through the city.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
Let them.
How romantic...
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
I would.
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
Good night, Alex.
I'm glad.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Why not?
Thank you.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
You liked it there.
Learning was important?
Did you have fires at night?
It must have been safe.
Mara...?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
I took a different route.
Why?
We choose to believe it.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
That's quite enough, Kalen.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Depends on what you're seeing.
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
They should just be looking harder.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
How?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
Yeah.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
No, he didn't.
To the hospital.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I'll die either way.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Well, what time is it?
It doesn't look all that different.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
You still don't believe me, do you?
What are you talking about?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
So what am I supposed to do?
[Beat] Thanks.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
You remember it?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
What?!
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
How are things goin' out there?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
What's wrong?
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Shut up.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
What the fuck is going on?
Not yet.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Isn't this fun?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Ready when you are.
Get the car!
Which part?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Taking a shower.
Yes!  I believe I am!
Try to.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Why not?!
Alright, Louise!
Just past Boise City.
Yeah.
Gosh.  It sure is.
We should have just ignored him.
Harlan.
Thelma!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Sorry!
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
What?!
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
How do you stay so positive?
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
All this for us?
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Yeah, but he was successful.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
What?
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
I already know it, Mary.
Some buildings I'm working on.
What's that?
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
That...? Vestibule.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Come on, what were you going to say?
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
No, not at all.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
So she's married?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Good good.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You're a sick man, you know that?
You mean him.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Four.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Hm?
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Why?
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Hi, Mary.
Oh yeah.
Just a minute.
Who's that?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
Trying to be.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Yeah, sure.
Toy poodle!
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
No, that's really unneces --
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Teddy, be brave.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Huh...?
What are you doing?
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We've got bigger problems right now.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Smoke.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
Yeah.
Says what, Kenny?
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Still heading for Cuba.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
No you weren't.
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
I know, I know...
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Rug samples.
Again. Figures, man.
Oh, yeah -- right.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
Goodbye.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Jesus...
Check him out, Ray.
Beats the hell outta me.
Good.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
She's that subtle?
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
After we've completed our investigation.
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Why should I tell you.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Ray --
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What?
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Go ahead, Ray.
I'm on my way back in. Over.
Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
How the hell do you know?
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
I'm with someone.
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Where were you?
Two miles.
You know. The finger.
You let me make a fool of myself.
Um. You.
Uh hum.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Used to what?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
Where?
Anything.
I'm still second best.
Where'd you get it.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Hardly ever.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
Take something off.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
What?  What is it?
The plane is fine.
Well what?
On what?
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Come on, relax...
What?
Come on. I died enough for one night.
SHIT!!
LOOK OUT!
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
No. You can be mine!
Nope.
Tell me one thing.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
Three guesses.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Me?
Yes sir!
The wings..
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
I lost.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
I know. I was there.
Or....
He was by the book, all the way.
I never heard that.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
The Last Resort.
Why not?
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
I know that.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Don't be an idiot.
What is it?
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Nice to meet you.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
That's right.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Swallow this.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Melina!
Rekall?
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
I've got Quaid.
Split up.  Find him.
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Some men just tried to kill me!
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Beats me.  I just work here.
I'm here at Rekall.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
What's he talking about?
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I used to model for 'em, why?
The reactor.
What?
No problem.
I think I scared it!
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Well, sure.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...
I'm gonna help you.
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
We got a plan!
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Civil?  I'm civil.
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Yeah, Val.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Let's assume that it is.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
It does.
They're working together, too.
You guys do all the odd jobs.
He was your snitch.
And one good guy.
Correct.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
Where's the nearest hospital?
The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
No. No...
Right. You're right.
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
Chinatown street gang.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
What, the lunatic who --
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
That's why I hate experts.
What's Art Esparza?
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
I've seen this picture before.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
...For ten years, now.
Neither.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
You don't drink "booze".
EXACTLY!
That's right.
Want to tell me what went down here?
...Okay...
"Painted"?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
You tell me, man.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Y-yes, sir.
This and that.
That's right.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
-- Every word.
Shouldn't one of us...?
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
And its purpose?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
Shu's the only one I know of...
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
A woman.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
I want you to kill for me.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
You killed Mike.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Did she have someone with her?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Tell me about the letter.
Someone else has it now.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Thanks.
What do you mean?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's what I heard.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Faulty wiring.
You didn't do your homework?
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
No.
WE got it back, that's all.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
No... No...
Hey, Jacques...
What? She asked about my father?
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Let's go all the way.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
James...
Everything, but everything.
"Oh, Laura..."
You mean the ones you pity.
Boating?
Sex?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Good night, sweetheart.
Not really.
Oh, Leland.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
Who am I?
Nothing, I chickened out.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
I'm fine.
Nothing.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
Gruber...
It looks that way.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
What does it mean?
No.
Yes.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You've just said you signed it.
I am seventy-four years old.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Yes.
Yes.
It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement...
Hold on a second.
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
That's what I'd planned to...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
No, you did fine.
Yes... I... yes.
Yes.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Why?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
I did.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
That happens.
Ready, your Honor.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Mr. Concannon...?
And what are you? A cop?
Laura.
You're talking like a drunk.
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is that to you...?
No.
From the magazine?
Missus...
And ask me what?
I didn't do it, Mister.
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...I understand...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
What do you want?
I'm going to help her.
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I think we tried that. The case is over.
The Doctors.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
Yes, that's correct.
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
But I think I know where she'll be....
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
It's gone now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
It was...  ...one of them!
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us something.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
D.O. to number three..come in.
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
I don't follow.
You get any sleep last night?
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
What?  What kind of episode?
Heather, has there been another call?
I'll be there in three hours.
No.
Oh my God...
He was just here!
You have a fever, sweetie?
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Home, that's right.
Right 'cross the freeway.
Coming for you...
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
What are you talking about?
Yes?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Black's fine.
Not yet.
Your father?
He knows.
Guilty.
I can take it.
What do you mean?
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Believe what?
I know.
What was that?
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
It was a bad dream...
Like this!
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
I know enough.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
No, I didn't.
I know you will.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Forget it.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Yes sir.
All stop on the engine.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
No.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
I can take care of myself.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
Why'd you jump?
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
It seems we're short on singers.
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
About anything.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
I'm not staying out here.
Joy, rapture...
I'm sorry...
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
What makes you so sure it was one?
It wasn't hard.
I am accountable.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Artie? That you, Artie?
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Yessir.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
She really say she was pregnant?
Have now.
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
No, of course.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
No sir...
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Muchas gracias.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
I'm sorry.
Yes, that's so. But there is not much to destroy.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
See ya downstairs.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Yeah?
What's that, peanut?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
You mean like pedal pushers?
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Who knows, baby?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
What's that?
Let's get outta here, honey.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Love you, too.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
You talk to 'im some?...
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
What if I asked you not to?
What if I told you not to?
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Whattya mean?
So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
You heard right.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Well?...
Thanks...
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
You're welcome.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
Isn't she?
I thought you were tinkering.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Only in your bones?
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
Ye-es?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Are you there to not reconcile with her?
Yea?
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Heaven?
I'll miss my bus.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Is he all right?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Blocked.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
No.
That's right. That one.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Okay.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Ah, wear whatever you want.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
I think so... What about you?
Just checking.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
Who does?
It beats 'What's your major?'
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
She's left before...
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
Caps.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
I heard.
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
I think I might have.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
Why yes. How did you know?
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
Oh... yeah.
As a heart attack.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
That's weird.
No, I'm going ho --
I haven't heard of half of those.
Beautiful. How's business?
I like the noise.
Is it because of Anna?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
No thanks.
What's that?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
I'm not a monster.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
The mother sure has her hands full.
I have no idea.
Little Red Riding Hood.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I went to bed around seven.
What?
Lovers' quarrel?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Yes?
Can't I stay a little longer?
What?
No way.
Ev-i-dence.
Of course.
Honest? No.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Have to talk about something.
I'm not that crazy.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
You mean my problem?
What?
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I don't see --
I see my sister.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
All right.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Yes.
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
I feel... okay.
Are you okay?
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
K through sixth.
I like the noise.
You must hate it.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
The worst?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
How young?
Twelve years in prison?
What?
I know.
What odds?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Which brother did this?
No you don't.
I'm not scared.
What's it look like?
Piece of cake, baby.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Wasn't up to me.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
That must be it.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
No.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
It's trying to communicate.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Calm down, Bud.
How?
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Tell me later.
Hi, lady.
Who then?
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Give me that!!
How many are there?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Check this out.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
Wait for what?
What! After giving us such a run around...
This one is gorgeous.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes, maybe that is better.
But then when will we see each other?
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
And what about you?
Who knows why they all left...
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
So, you wonder why?
Nothing.
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I deserve it.
Better dead.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
To do what?
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
You say that just to flatter me.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
But why all nudes?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
We'll try again.
Me... Goffredo, you're mad!  He's mad.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Unfortunately, no.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
No. The owners are in Australia.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
Is that far from here?
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
He talked to you Himself?
Who?
He loves you the way you are.
Who told you this?
That's not what he meant.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
I love you.
Yes.
Oh, yes!
At least once a week.
In the confessional.
Would you like to ask them?
Not at the moment, no.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Somebody told her.
I don't know.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Yes.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
I'm always bad.
No...
I can't.
Yes.
Her headaches.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Yes.
Because I wasn't worthy.
She made me promise not to.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
Go away, I don't want you here.
No... don't hit me please...
What did she mean?
Why?
Yes.
Who?
Yes.
I put her to sleep.
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
Thanks...
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Who are you?
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
Yes... I...
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Yes.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
I haven't a clue.
None as far as I know.
Obviously there was.
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
Then help her.
What is it?
What sheets?
About what?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Oh, dear God.
I knew that after the fact.
Don't deny it!
Bullshit!
Nothing...
I'd love one.
All right?
Hand rolled.
Yes I do.
Begin what?
Of course.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
Who is he?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Is it because she's a nun?
Yes.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
No!
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Then she's a liar.
What happened to the baby?
Wasn't it!
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
I'm a deserter, too.
Read 'em!
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
You do - repeatedly.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Of course I can.
I'll have a bash.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Have I said something amiss?
No, straight up.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
He's sulking again.
You crawler.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Sorry.
Eh, there's only three of them.
How'd you guess?
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
Oh ... I dunno.
What?
Nothing good.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
For Ringo.
What little old man?
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Aye, before anyone stops us.
So's mine.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Hello.
No, not me.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Well ...
He'll get over it.
Y'what?
Sorry.
Good lad, Ringo.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
And they want me?
You were twanging too loud.
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Hell, we're equipped --
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Dell, plot our location.
Yeah.  Two hours.
I'll see what I can do.
What's the terrain down there?
Is it solid?
Then take her down.
Receiving.
Looks like a derelict.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Take care.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
Play it for us, please.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It grows on you.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
That way.
Dead.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Right.
Right.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Right. 
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
It wouldn't come.
Careful, don't get under it!
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Can you do anything for him?
Don't be an idiot.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I've completely lost their signal.
No.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
You lead.
How far?
Sun will be down in a minute.
Can you see anything?
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Yes, thank heaven.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
Is it still dripping?
We're going into the freezers now.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Let's get moving with this net.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Close...
That tube must be depositing it in him.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Engine room, what happened?
Found what?
Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
... More spores coming.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Okay, give me the numbers.
We're what!?
Shit.  When?
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
It's alright, it's cool...
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
What?  Why?
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Is that a fact.
And before that?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Real man' drink.
Hold on...
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
I... I can't!
No!
You should hit the sack, too.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
That's right.
Yes. The Shubert.
Eddie...
I believe I will.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
D-day.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
You have no right to say such things!
... and Karen.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
A dull cliche.
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
What of it?
What of it?
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Yes, Addison.
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
You're being childish.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
Hear, hear...
Then you've heard too.
Margo.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
Huh?
I'll try.
As of this moment you're six years old...
Call me when you get in...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
How is Eve? Okay?
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
Cut it out.
That never stopped you before.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
I don't think that's funny!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
For instance - you!
- guilty.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
Who?
Gone.
Okay. Mix.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Here we go...
Now don't get carried away-
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
What would you like? Texas?
Groom.
A married lady.
I just asked a simple question.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
Of course!
Oh-oh.
Now you want an argument.
Night an' day.
Like an agent with one client.
Don't be dense. The party.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
You were just looking around...
What for?
Probably not.
I've heard of them.
Subway.
Oh, no...
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I'd like that.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Over my dead body...
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Thank you, Karen.
'Remembrance'.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Hello, Miss Channing.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
I'm so happy you're happy.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Well...
About what?
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute!
Such as?
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
... Among so many quiet qualities.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
You'd have been proud of her.
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Poor Max. Heartburn?  It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
Yeah?
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Hmm.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--a spy, you mean?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
Nixon.
You voted for him.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
How high up, which Republicans?
We're inside the White House now.
Hmm?
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
That's right.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I didn't.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
--Deep Throat?--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
Where are your bills, Carl?
There's always a later plane.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
Which people?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
I will not talk about the other two.
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
You're a lawyer and you're here--
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I have nothing more to say.
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
No.
It is.
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
Lotsa hints--
--well, Sloan--
--go over your sources again--
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
--can we use their names?--
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
Haldeman.  Right?
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
Of course--everything they asked--
The what to what?
-- Thanks, coach --
Sure.
Suck me...beautiful?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Single malt?
Uh-huh.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Seduce her.
Why is this?
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
Because I want to.
How did you know I was here?
You talked to Stifler?
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
That's nice.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
What?
What's that?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Sure.
I don't get it, that really works?
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Uh...
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Went home to shit.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
I'm not going.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Don't you want me to?
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Okay.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Strip?
Move with the music.
Nadia, I can't --
Oh no.
God dammit, Stifler!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
You want to do it?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
I don't know.  How do you?
Yeah.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
What's that?
Once, in church, dude.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
He didn't?
Shut the fuck up.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
No shit.
Thanks.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
But you better hurry.
No it isn't! You're dead!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I know. He told me.
Andy! No!
A cure?
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
Fuck me...
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
You too.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
And you call me a moron...
Oh shit... No...
Why the fuck would I do that?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Andy? Andy is that you?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
How well did, er, do you know him?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Yes sir.
He says -
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Double merde.
What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
I know, but I had to because . . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
I'm not sure but look. . .
Well, I don't have any money . . .
I'm fine.
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Now just get off the train.
It's the best fork of all
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
How do you know?
You'd lose your security deposit?
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Shut up!
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Rasputin!
Run, Anya -  go...
Young	man, I...
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Alvy.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Well, stop listening to him.
How can you possibly oversleep?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
M'm.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Hey, that was last year.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
You-you play... very well.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Neat, yeah.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Okay.
Oh.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
M'hm.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
I have a tiny apartment.
Mine.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Well, have you ever made love high?
It relaxes me.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
I didn't follow you!
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Yeah?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Yeah.
It was just great!
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Nothing at all?
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Oh-
Thanks, honey.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
You're mad, aren't you?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, do yuh?
Tell him.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Right, Max. California, Max.
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
V.P.L.?
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
And... uh-
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
His wife has diabetes!
...of possibly working together.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
I don't know. I don't know.
A long time.
Oh yes.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
Why didn't you come in?
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Don't you miss it?
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Yeah.
Count on it.
Fuck you.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Lucy overdosed.
She's in ICU.
Leave us alone right now.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Probably not.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Through the sweats or not?
No.  I missed that.
We're great.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
I'm going to throw up.
I'll say as little as possible.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
It's taken care of.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Otis!
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
That is not true.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't do this.
You're not ready.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I have no idea who you are.
Come on, Panes...
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
No you're not.
Hm.
And you know, he really does not.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Lemon.
Come here.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
Trust him.
Time!
Well...wow...
I'm sure you understand.
Oh?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Yeah.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Oh great.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
No, really, five thousand with your discount.
Thanks.
Rose.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Yes.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
You weren't exactly horrified.
Why are you doing this?
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Quiet -- sshhh!!
How should <u>I know</u>?
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Well...no, but --
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Oh, no, sir!
I...I have no idea, sir.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
What do I do?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Something the matter?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Oh!
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Why?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
So I see.
How come?
Much better.
Why?
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
I mean -- her apartment.
No -- it's my stomach.
They had to pump it out.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Give what up?
A cemetery?
You really think so?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
I guess so.
A what?
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Cheers.
The dishes?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine all over.
Shut up and deal!
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
That's very flattering.
That's right, Baxter.
You better.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Yes, sir.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
You too, sir.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
I know how it is.
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
What do you mean, sorry?
How's that again?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What do you want?
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
I have a vague idea.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Sure.
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
No.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Not particularly.
No.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
I took sleeping pills.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Important?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Atlantic City?
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
What gives?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
My men --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
One for all -- all for one --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Yeah. Way north.
Fat. That's real fat.
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
Call me what, sir?
How much is left?
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Yeah, I know.
... he's an amazing officer.
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
We're Americans.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
When'd you do it?
What is it?
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Would he remember you ?
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
What is it?
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
They must have seen the fire.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
About what ?
But why ?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Boss left.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
I got bored in Saigon.
No. Walked.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
It'll get here, soldier.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
I'm Kurtz.
You know you're right.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
Both of us...
What?
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
Which one's the Colonel's?
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
And shut up.
Yes.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
I do.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Son of a bitch, sir.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
157  CONTINUED:
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
She's dead.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
It's exactly what you meant.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
A daughter in Oregon.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You know Meyerling?
You got one?
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
Don't bet on it.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
Shut up!
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
I got it from here.  Thanks.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
What does this matter to you?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
Huh?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Don't be silly. How bad?
Uh-huh.
Emergency room only.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
His home number.
How old are you?
How do you know about my mother?
How ya doing?
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Welcome.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
To hell with sex.
I'll take a bus.
I can trust my brain.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Okay. Good-bye.
Were you asleep?
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Okay.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
About a dog.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Get out.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
I'm coming.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
I forgot to lock the door.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
What is this?
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
How long have you been freelance?
We go around once.
What?  What's okay?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
I ain't scared of you.
What?
Why don't you tell me.
You're too late.
Yes, sir.
Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.
$1,000,000.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
One hour per man.
What?  How did you know I had a cat?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Ten million --
'Them'?
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Why?
The C.I.A.?
You went from high school to the Agency?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Tell me about the first time.
Are they usually like that?
Where is it?
Here?
Sorry.
The beach?  It was nice.
Thank you.
Okay.  Then what?
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
That means you won't have a gun.
We split the money?
Except --
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I didn't notice them.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Why?
I'm not normal.
What?
Right.
What?
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
Everyone regrets something.
Yes.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Thank you.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
That makes you an expert I guess.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Can you do the lock on it?
But how did the wall get here?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Is it gone four-thirty?
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Who put a bee up your butt?
Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
I fell in love.
No, the boyfriend.
What are you on about?
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
He got that one right.
So?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Doug?
No!
No!
Regards to Her Majesty.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Really?
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
Fernet and tonic.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
It's not so much.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great....How long will it go for?
Ah, so what?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
What for?
What is bail?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Well she sure isn't normal.
Am I invited?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
I had it coming from someone.
Yeah, but it was okay.
It's Josh's.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Fuck you!
No!
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Yeah!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
Well come on, sit down.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
You're fine like that, Mom.
I meant he's a doctor.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
I need to whizz.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
You do --
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
It was.
I don't want to have any conversation.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Don't bother!
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
You don't believe in anything?
Yes. And?
Belinda's a very jealous person.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
When I have something to say.
What?
Why not?
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Fun.
You're sometimes not sure?
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
Yes, one of many.
No.
That's what I mean.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
No.
Dad --
Either. Both.
I'm not tired.
In there.
Yes. You?
She did. It was you.
Please.
I'd work backstage or something?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
Oh yeah.
Uh, thanks...
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
Coming, Eileen...
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Learn anything?
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
I'm going to be at the dance.
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
What's this all about?
Shhhhhhhh!
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
...To be traveled through
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
The power converter...
We don't....
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Perfect...
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
The Orpheum.
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
What's going on?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Thirty aught six.
Sure.
Tom...
Thanks.
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
Nah, I got me a job.
Sure.
He'll say that?
There you go.
Well, stop the world.
Spanish.
I don't know.
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
It's your play.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
I don't care.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
I just don't want to go.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Maybe.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Wanta sue me?
Then that's it!
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Let her out. In my custody.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
The door's locked.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Pretty terrible shot.
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Which?  The one in my throat.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
I didn't drop 'em.
Flying to Cambodia.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Please, Barton.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Hello.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
I want to know!
Bill –
Drown all those rascals...
...Who?
Well... actually, no Bill...
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
Ever act?
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
To see pap.
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Doesn't surprise me at all.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
See you, Charlie.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Nope.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
...Both maybe?
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Congratulations.
Must be.
Yeah.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Anyway.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Give you nose bleeds?
Only fry you once.
Home. Watching TV.
Thanks.
Bring 1976 up.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
Who?
I thought you quit.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
What?
I know who you are.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
No.
No, thanks.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
Do you?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
What's it about?
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
No?
Try me.
Why?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Did you miss me?
Somebody always does.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
No.
He was murdered.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
Cocaine.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
What was the weapon?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
I know what that's like.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
You're my friend, Gus.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
No.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
No. Should I have?
Not sure. How was yours?
Do you ever get sick of it?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
We can do better. It needed more white.
That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
You haven't been by lately.
You want a drink?
How about right now?
Sure.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
Decipher?
Who said that?
SAMO.
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
For real?
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
Can I walk you home?
It's Monday morning.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You want some?
I hadn't thought about it.
You're your own baby.
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
It's three thousand dollars!
That's great.
Stand still.
Thanks
Wanna Mac?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
A what?
Yeah.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I will relay the message.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
...four, five.
We do.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Have we?
Yes and no ...
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
Photojournalist.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
One way to find out?
He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
Dad!  Save yourself!
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
PMS.
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Too late for what, dear child?
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Everyone dies, Master Bruce.  There's no defeat in that.  Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live.
What seems to be the problem?
Coming on line now, sir.
Keep it.
You'd be surprised.
I hate being lectured.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
He'll be here.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Maybe he melted.
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
She wants to kill you.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
Adam and Evil.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How ya doin', Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
Not much.
I'm not-
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What I do isn't about revenge.
Who is it?
Yesssssss. I know!
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Miss.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Take me. Let the boy go.
What are you talking about?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
... Terror.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
I've considered that possibility.
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
What?  I improved her a little...
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Tom Jones?
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
Your face smells like a foot.
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Thanks, Annie.
Night.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Excuse me.
Yes, isn't he.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
A car sounds sensible.
Sean Connery.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Why thank you sir.
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Of course he is.
What?
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, really.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
Yer late.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
That's better. Yes?
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
No, Jane.
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
How's your arm?
I am sitting.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
This is going to take some time.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
<u>You</u> left me.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
That's all we need.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Maybe we should knock first?
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
<u>Out</u>.
We're...
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
Our cemetery?
Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
Step... mother.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
And live in what, our station wagon?
I want to get in.
Yes.
Good girrrl!
That's it!
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
You've got to help them.
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Stepmother.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Gooood!
Viridian?
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
Their wedding clothes.
But not for long...
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
In a day or two, yes.
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Yes. I am.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
Your family doctor?
I agree.
Hello, Eve.
Yes.
No. It won't do that.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
I am a very good gardener.
Fine. He's very nice.
Yes.
... Mentor...?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Our greenhouse.
No, thank you.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Hello, Morton.
I don't want Robert.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Ben is very ill.
I certainly do.
Oh, good.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
I understand.
I see, Ben.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
Oh, I see.
Hello, Ronald.
What sort of bed is it?
I never needed money.
No.
Good day, Sally.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Of course. I would like to look.
... Yes. You can take me.
... Yes sir - elevator!
You're welcome.
Yes. That is surprising.
No. I don't object.
I am a very serious gardener.
I see...
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Good evening, Wilson.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Right, Chief.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Yes, I did.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Mr. Gardiner...
Oh yeah, he's good.
Who am I thinking of?
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
The monkey.
I... puppeteer.
Hi.
We'll talk about it in the car.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
What?
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
The iguana?
You came up here looking for the portal?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Schwartz.
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
My tits?
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
It better be.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
A scary dream?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You mean with Malkovich?
Derek Mantini!
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
Well what?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
Was a time I knew what was.
You remember Halle.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
Yes?
Yes ma'am..
I miss her.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Go upstairs I said!!
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
I don't know him that well.
You was friends.
I run him off.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
All he can. All he can.
Make it the way I always do.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Why me, man?
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Oh, nothin', you know.
Shit.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Fuck you.
Nothing.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
I'm going home, Donny.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
No--
Well--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Uh-huh.
Lebowski on the right?
Far out.
Separate incidents?
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Delayed after-eff--
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Uh-huh.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
But he's--
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
MARK IT ZERO!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Huh?
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Huh?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
The bulk of the series.
Not exactly a lightweight.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Come on, Walter!.
Wha.
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
I don't know, sir.
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Walter!
Stay away from me, mister!
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
Survival.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Minutes.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
For what?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Why?
Either that or feeding the worms.
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
For what?
Not alone.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Getting your attention, Paco.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
You experimented on your own, son?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Us?  What are you talking about?
Are we bringing home strays now?
Just do it, old man.
Don't even start, old man.
How can you be out here?
Take him.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
I'm sorry, I --
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
And that's a good thing?
Preventive medicine.
Look closer.
How can you tell?
Like me.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Blade --
For your miracle cure?
Cancer.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
I've been better --
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
No problem.
Sometimes --
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
I'll take my chances.
How?
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
My eye, is there something in my eye?
Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
Closer.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Mrs. Leavitt--
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
The Witch's voice.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
So whoever built this--
Not the only things missing, Nick.
Oh, sorry, right.
--Nick!!
It's like traveling back in time.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Why is there no "our" here?
You feel no need to get married or anything.
You said the name "James."
I don't know. Nightmare.
--bullshit!
--Cotter's--
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
You have to go.
I can't.
Both. Now.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Ask me what I don't have.
No.
What're you, nuts?
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
Fucking owl!
How's she going to know where to--
--I saw what I saw.
<u>What</u>--
Anna's the witch.
--a Wiccan--
I am.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
Asleep--
All I need--
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
Enough to keep sane.
One of the printers.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Ah, Domini?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
Then I have no idea.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
What?
Get some more beer.
I'm sorry.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Does she, goddamnit??
I don't....
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
--the Sheriff's Office--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Yes.
Meurice--
I just gotta see a guy.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
...Huh?
I couldn't believe it either...
Yeah? What happened?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
I don't know. I better get off now.
You're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
...What do you mean?
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
I think someone's watching.
Thanks.
About ten years.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
See, I never knew that.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
What do you mean...
How long did you watch her?
Ya catch any fish?
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yes.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Yes?
The criminals are winning.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
No. not at all.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Yeah.
Jeffrey.
Then you got undressed.
No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Then don't talk about killing.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Hello.
I sure don't hate you.
That's good.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
It's okay. it's okay.
They hurt his head.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Go where?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Terrible. boring.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Where are they?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
I'll drink to that.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Yeah.
He got a little jealous.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Yes.
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Jeffrey?. Why?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
... You look beautiful.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead!
uh uh.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Yeah.
That sounds great!
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
You can change it if you want to.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
Motherfucker works fast.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Derek!
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
You're a fucking amateur!
I see.  How much?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
I would if I could get some sleep.
I just got released five minutes ago.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?
Oh, I see.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Un sapo?
Yes, it is.
Power?
Beautiful girls?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
And Diego?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
That was a beautiful message.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
George, he wasn't asking.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
California.
Where are you going?
You swear?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
Swear on my life.
It's alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
So, we need to get to the source.
Who speaks Spanish?
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
That's right.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
I understand. What's your question?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sid Ahmed.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don't complain.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
Let's try ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
Good evening, sir.
Of course I am.
How can I give you this statement?
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
You got something on the coke?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
How?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
She didn't.  She just left.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What did she say?
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
Cocaine.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
No.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
That's all Dr. Paley.
No.
Chinese peony root.
It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
No.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Yes -- he did.
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
No.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
He video taped you.
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
Yes.
Why'd you come here?
Because he called me.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Yes.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
You still haven't answered my question.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Yes.
I know.
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
She's mistaken.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
Honey.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
She's waiting in the conference room.
You better.  Please answer the question.
I'm always open to learning new things.
He could let you have your vacation.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Yes.
We have to talk.
No.
Talk to me.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Oh Jesus.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
I said NO!
No. You can have them.
Well, there's a problem.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
No. We're going to lock this up and --
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, yes.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
Maybe it's because I live here.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
Not at all.
Much.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
She starts sniffing me.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
What?
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No. But I love them just the same.
Do you want to leave your husband?
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Nobody's asking you to.
Trouble. Why?
What?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
What makes it different, Robert?
For who?
What about us? What about me?
Yeah. It could get better.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
But now that you have it -
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
Nah.
What's her name?
What's she like?
How the hell should I know?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Climb out to where?
What it will be.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Just try it.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
We met.
I have to finish this for class.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
I can't find you.
You got the shit?
Fuck it.  Alright.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Yeah, you heard of him?
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
No thanks.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
But the place burned to the ground.
What's that, Johnnie?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
Jesus, Caesar!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
But you know he did it.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, maybe we should run --
The money?  The money's gone.
No.
This is insane!
The hell I can't!
We're going to need some time.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
You betrayed me!
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
Good boy.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
I'm listening.
I should have let him kill you.
Go right ahead, sir.
Five.
Why?
Are you okay, Violet?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
This is the police, ma'am.
Good guess.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
You're doing everything yourself?
I knew it.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
What do you want?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
Yes, it is.
So am I.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
What choice?
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
An accident.
I won't.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Violet?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Right.
...I understand...
Oh, Jesus... 
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
Then I'll find another ride.
Listen to what you want.

Nothing.  It's just not there.
I was shot twice in the back.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
That's it?  Is that it?
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
...omigod, no...
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
I didn't know this would happen.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
-- forget it --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
Who paid the bill?
I don't know. 
You could do that?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
What's that?
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
I don't know.
Thank you.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
Machines don't fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
... have a look.
...aven't you?
...Yer nostril?
...sabotage!
It's reply paid.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
You sound worried.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Yes, thanks.
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
What is it?
How do you mean?
Not much.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
You got the wrong man.
I'm sure you have
Very smart.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Why?
You're the only person I can trust.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
Shut up!
What?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Them?
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I didn't like it.
What?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
A heavy Christmas present.
Well, all wars do -
Well, terrorists of course.
Every day?
Get away!
Let go! We've got to stop!
Oh God! What have we done?
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Go away.
Leave me alone!
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
No you're not!
Where are you going?
It's not our mistake!
I delivered it.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Sam Lowry.
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much.
I won't be held responsible.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Thank you for calling Cen -
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Numero, trois.
Have you got one or haven't you?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
What?
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
You can trust me on this one.
Mary, we really have to go.
No!
Dead.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
No, I'd better not.
What?
His heart's beating.
At least he's got people around him.
Our Lady of Misery.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
How long you been doing this?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
There's no time.
Frank.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
I think the worst is over.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Look out!
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
That's ridiculous.
You learn that in the army?
Frank!
No shit.
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
He's drunk.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You really think so?
Yeah.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
No?
I'll put her on.
Why?  What did they do to you?
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Yes.
Ravenous homosexual.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Sure.
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
Really?
Wipe me out?
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
No.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
Almost immediately.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Yes, there is.
I'll never tell.
Yes.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
Should I...
No stop where he's all besieged.
Bobbie, please.
Bad manners.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
One's enough.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Tell me I'm on the way in.
Honey?...
No.  Not even you.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Fill for a second.
I was a lot earlier.
Yes, sure.
So great -- right?
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
Yes.
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Well, what is it?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Who?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
How can you say that to me?
That's yes?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
I'm sorry.
Not anymore!
Shh!
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Carla -
Walter, I'm sorry...
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
What are you doing here so early?
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Why not?
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
Enough already about it - get to work!
I don't have another cat!
I-I already got a new one!
Yeah and what would I say?
Just wait till you see this!
Excuse me I have to make a call...
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Yeah I did.
Huh?!!!
C-connection?
Smack?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Yes, get rid of them...
Here here!
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
If you see him.
I was just straightening up the place.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
What's the matter with you!
Litter, yeah!
What's with you?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Amazing!
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Bummer metaphor.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
You look like shit, Benny.
Down there.
Eeyuu.
It's the news, Buffy.
Nothing.
'Bye.
So I noticed.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
You weren't home.  Like always.
I think you've forgotten something.
Hi there.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
I should have known.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Get out of my facial.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
Yes.
I have to show you.
All right.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Oh.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
As for example, what?
And where are they now?
He knows who I am!
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
Thank you very much.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Thanks.
Sorry.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
Could be.
Could be.
Oh, baby!
Jeffrey!
Nee sitch.  No way.
Does Jeffrey know?
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Right.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
I don't think so.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
My right nostril?
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
You don't have to...
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
Yep.
So...Wanta make love?
That's my job too.
You're pulling your hips out.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
I want to be had.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Yeah...you a witch?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
What's it say?
Oh let's not...
Who's he play for?
Never heard of 'em.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
If you believe in Voodoo.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
You're a cocksucker!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
But he ain't seen my heat--
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
You been in the Majors?
Naw...
Go for it.
God--what a Big League move.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Jesus.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
C ' mon!
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Can I give you my testimony?
We're getting married.
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
What are you talking about?
Good to see ya.  William would you...
Liar.
Was I at that dinner?
Philip, if you would rise.
What do you propose?
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fuckin' hero sandwich here.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Lester...
702 472 1862.
Right back.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Okay.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Matter of fact...
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
No.
Between...
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
Hey.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
I lost control?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Hey, she came to talk...
Meet me at three.
No, a...
Why?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
It's me.
Well...
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
No, that's quite all right.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Seven o'clock.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Why is she eight pounds over?
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
No. Just stop everything.
See you, Ginger.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
No.
No, he didn't.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Yeah, how do I know?
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Pretty serious.
And...
Okay?
With what?
At the most, which is impossible for him.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
And where'd you go?
What'd you have?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
I can back him off.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You understand? What? Let you go?
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
I'm not -
Not gonna let me in?
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
How many kids do you have?
Eight children! 
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Green?
God! 
Mm.
Thanks, Nick.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Well, I've been busy. 
He won't...
I understand.
Go get a bag, man.
I can't.
Pitch-black?! It -
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
Yeah?
Here we go!
I did - I didn't -
Oh.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
We can't help him if -
How are you?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
I understand.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
Oh, come on.
Yeah.
Bye.
I don't - 
Yeah?
You did. You're right.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
A sponsor.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
All right. Be careful.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
Promise?
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
Here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
No, I'm gonna drive.
They check in alone?
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
All right.
Two.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
But he never talked.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
No more! You see? Watch!
Ch-Charlie M!
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
In women?
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
Even the skylight?
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
What did you say?
Absolutely.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
I still have one left...
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Spear.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
I actually got some memory back last night.
Actually, yes.
What?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Uh-huh..
But I'm blind.
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Trust me, you won't have to.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
Where do you think you're going?
This is one way.
Taking messages.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Theo wants to talk again.
You could've killed us.
Why would I do that?
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
It's taken care of.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
I don't believe you.
My name is --
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Another minute.
What about the others?
Sometimes I paint.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I can hear you again, clearly.
No.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Your husband?
You're all three of you in that van?
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
You knew about me.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
That's not good enough.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
You won't live to see it.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
I don't want it.
Who is this?
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
We don't see you.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
I won't let 'em.
Call me "Nels."
The fuck I will!
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Mind if I have a look?
Who are you?
Hold on.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
I'm sorry.
See what, Dil?
Did he?
What do you think his name is?
Persistent.
I would expect he does.
Please, Dil --
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
No.
Who's she?
Not me.
Yes, thank you.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
Jesus.
The things a girl has to put up with.
Whiskey.
Tell me about him.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
What is this?
Aha.
Depends what it is.
I'm thinking of your man.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
No...
Give it over, Dil --
You mean that?
You think that's wise?
I know that.
When?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Not here.
You following me?
What's her?
I'm not sure.
Anything.
No. Sit down.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
You knew which man?
You knew my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
I suppose I tried.
Okay.
Never.
I promise.
The Metro.
Don't call me that --
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Need to go across the water.
He's hot.
Suits you.
Yes.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
You know what. Go.
You may be right.
I take pride in my work.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
I told him.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Should blow you away, you know that?
Aye, I do, Peter.
A hotel?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Right.
Am I?
I can smell her perfume.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
And you know the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
No.
What?
Suppose you could say that.
My pleasure, Jody
Give us a break.
Yeah?
I've often wondered how you do it.
What do you believe in?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I don't know her.
A story.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Hurling --
You don't know me, do you?
Whatever you say, Jude...
He believes in the future --
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
That's right.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Can you remember anything at all?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
I'm through listening to you!
Here, give it to me.
We? You mean you're --?
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Thanks very much.
But --
Who?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
But no one actually saw him die.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Brian.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
I said with the mouth shut.
Open it.
That's the idea.
Then who does?
Me?
It's all right with us --
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Okay.
You did.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
Alex --
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
I don't believe it.
It's a start, anyway.
Well!
Go on.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
And the last one?
Here's ten.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
Not unless we're blind.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
Tell me what?
I don't know anything.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Up there! I would put it up there!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Now you're angry.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
I don't know where to go.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Starting tonight?
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How would you like a spanking?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
I don't understa--
Wha -- what do you want?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
The American Embassy.
Not my imports.
I get the imports.
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Daddy you scared me!
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
What's wrong?
How much further?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
It can't be.
No I wasn't.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
Run!
Are you sure?
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
She just turned off her light.
This will relax her.
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
You're not?
Who's?
What?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
He says he loves me.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
No.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I'm fine.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Did Sharon say no?
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
This party is sick.
Yeah. Who is she?
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
The word is Mob.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
No, you keep one.
No.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
ROD!
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
...shit.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/STAIRWELL - DAY.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.

...and a shitload of ice.
...-tana.
...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
...-er.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
Are you kiddin'?
 Excuse me...
You'd better coast through...
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
You stole this truck.
God-...
Okay, okay! 
Okay.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
All right, you got it.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Come on!
I know the likeli-...
...Night Shift, but you might...
Come on, old...
Whoo!
 I made it.
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 


Okay.
These'll keep it cold.


Oh, no!
Worth a try.
...-tion?
...stole the truck.
...overdrawn bank accounts.
So you took his...
...hospital.
We got two paddles.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
...-er.  It was your friend...
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...or my conscience.
Huh?

 Come on!
Okay. 
 That's why I didn't give it...
What?
...they come!
 What's it say? 
What?
 
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
Look out.

Who had to put a gun to your head?
Hello.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
That's bullshit.
Oh, oh!
Yeah.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
Listen, shithead!
So...where's my truck?
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
  Hey, actually...
...-lem too?

Any of them Richard Long?
If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Almost quaint.
Forget about him.
...happen if I drop this?
Pleasant surprise.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....

Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Get your links set up!

 But...

Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...though.


Where's Elvis?!


Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...he's smart enough to get you...
EXT. DAM - DAY.
Kabula's out.
What's going on, colonel?
Get ready to take it out!
...son.
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
I will tell you what I...
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
...-to a simple thing like...
Doc!
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Doctor.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
We've got the real thing!
...-lem?
Got that?
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
All right, go.

'Course you do, Jake.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
That's right.
If that's what it says.
Thanks.
It doesn't hurt.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
I think I gave it to her.
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Could you drive me somewhere?
I don't know...
Plus what I owe you?
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
You sure this is okay?
I've been wanting to meet you.
Thank you...
Summer colds are the worst.
Oh yes.
No?
I don't.
I heard it was an accident.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
I guess not.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Of course.
Do you know where she might be?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
What are you having?
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
What do you mean?
I'll stop by.
A check?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
How did you find out?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
That your maiden name?
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
No.
And Hollis knew about it?
Is that unusual?
Why?
What were you doing there?
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
You saw my fa... father? When?
You didn't tell me.
Give me an example.
Including the death of your husband?
The police?
She's not tied up!
What about?
Aren't you coming back with me?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
She's my daughter.
She's my sister.
He didn't wear bifocals.
When did you come in?
Oh no.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Ida Sessions.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
When it comes? What'd you tell him?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
But I have to know.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah, I'll do that.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Yes. No.
Yes.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Yeah.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
She ran away?
You don't say?
Fifty lire... 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Then why don't you change jobs? 
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
Too bad!
Why? What do you mean?
Yes. 
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
We'll talk about that later.
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
OK...
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
I didn't see that.
Oh!
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
You know why?  She was so -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Are they standing for me?
I don't my plans myself.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
We've got a nice plant here.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
Susan, I really think -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
You can't stop me.
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
I'd like that.
What's wrong, Brad?
Why, Brad?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
Yes.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
What about that apartment?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
I feel nauseous.
Dante. You've got a customer.
How do you know that?
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Let me take you out tonight.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Sang.
So what are you saying?
What time was this?
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
So I'm told.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Oooh! Navy Seals!
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Bunch of savages in this town.
You called Caitlin again?
What do you two fight about?
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
All right, Vader's boss...
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
There's more?
And you figured it out?
Basically.
And the second time around...?
Each egg has to be perfect.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
What?
I know.
Sorry.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
An embarrassing way to die.
How'd he die?
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
I don't want to talk to you.
Let me borrow your car.
What?
I know I'm your hero.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
Five hundred dollars.
Living proof.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
I'm not.
What time did we go to the funeral?
What are you talking about?
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
Jesus.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Helluva day.
Yes.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
Yeah?
No, she's getting married.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
Meaning?
I'm trying.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
She called you, didn't she?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Twelve.
Three.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
He gets off on it.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm serious...
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Dante...
Lower your voice!
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
...it isn't there. Yes.
Veronica, I love you...
What?
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
You'll be missed.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
You're not?
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
That woulda been cool.
What usually eats a banana?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Hey, fuck you.
Okay--I don't know about this.
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
You attacked me.
Yeah?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
Breathtaking.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Never
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
There, what's that place?
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Then go fetch.
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Richard Travers.
You bastards... bastards.
I've been cured.
Won't you join me, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Help me, sir?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Alex.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Well, how are you then?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
No, sir.
Crabs?
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
How're you feeling this morning?
We're going to friends now, sir.
Vitamins will it be then?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Yes.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Sir.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Four in this block, sir.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Bottega.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
When was the last time you took one?
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Max...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Yes.
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Oh, my, yes.
'Fraid so.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I think...
Federal?
Very generous.
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
I don't know...
Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Elvis?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
I've been calling and calling.
What's he sayin'?
Yo, whassup?
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
Who the hell is this?
Who is this?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
It's not that kind of job.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
You're cool.
Yeah.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
I tried it.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Yes.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Who was he?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I don't understand...
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
She's in the hospital.
It's not bullshit.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Dmitri?
Who?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
One more.
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Let her go.
Geronimo?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Drop me off here!
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Shut the hell up.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Switch the charts.
What is?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
This would be it?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
They're big details, Jerry.
Okay, I will.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
What?
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
This way.
Did you kill my father?
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
They'll trace it.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Without a love of my own.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Could you be a little more specific?
A dog bit it.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
Excuse me?
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
Yes, that's right.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
I was just thinking that.
And Jonas?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
I'm willing to take that risk.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
With me.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
Ellie.
I don't understand.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
But what do I say?
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
-- of Hadden Industries.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
That's what they all say.
Ellie --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
It's really happening.
Make that two.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Can you try?
Yes.  Very much.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
It's late.  We should go back.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
-- I don't know --
Hi.
I do.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Git your shovel and git to work.
Git movin', I said.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Here, Mom.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
Pair'a nines.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
He's gonna be awright.
A Lucas Jackson.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Fifty's a nice round number.
We got it locked in the sock.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Call.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
What did I do?
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
Hal has it.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
What Friday?
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
I think this is number three...
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Nothing.
It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
Then what do you need me for?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Why should I trust you?
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
Over here.
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Look at her legs.
Right.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
You messed with the evidence.
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
One of your suitors?
I'd like to go back. James...
Are we imagining it?
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Yes.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
You could get your wish at any moment.
Where are you?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Truly.
Do you think I should?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
That's thanks to all your help.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Come on.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
Lie?
Terrific.
I wasn't hungry.
Paul.
Good God.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
I better make a list.
Really?
It's sex time.
No.
You, too. Kick ass today.
Yeah?
You got wine. That's great.
Are you OK?
The restaurant, too?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
I guess so.
And all the plans we have.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I'm calling in sick.
Something you did?
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
So, what do you say, Let?
No, no.
No...
I've met someone else.
No.
He's a patient here.
I start on Monday.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Where did they go?
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
He missed three weeks.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
I guess we're going to find out.
Half the tapes.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
We can't.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Cops?
I can't believe you didn't check.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
What for?
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Good idea.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Okay boss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Good song though.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm not going to leave you.
What the hell is he talking about?
Get in the car.
The hell it is.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, I dig him.
Watch this.
Wait here.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
And you don't speak French?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
We don't know that for sure.
Tonight.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
A car.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
Let's go!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
How so?
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Then you have no use for the sword.
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Let them look.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
I knew she would intrigue you.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
A murderer?
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
We must avenge mother!
What does it say?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
How 'bout the morgue?
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Mister Funboy lives there?
No.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I think he's yours, now.
Mom tried to cook.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Another jolly nickname?
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Your pain ends now.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Shelly?
Go away.
Fine with me.
I'm already alone.
18k.  Crap.
Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Kill a dead guy?
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
Excuse me?
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
No.
You did?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
That's a matter of opinion.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
No thank you.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
Yes.
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Of Human Bondage.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Okay.
I do not.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
I have feelings for you.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
What are you saying?
I love you.
- none taken -
Greg McConnell.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
I don't think that bothered him.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
It was nothing.
I don't know.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
I did?
Just taking your photo.
I want to go home.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
I know.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Same time next week?
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
And you think she bought it?
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
Outstanding.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Blow me.
But who will they turn to for help?
Have you succeeded in your task?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
With who?
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Well done.
I accept. Now get out.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get out!
I think you have your answer.
I'll do my best.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Excuse me.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
You're a lucky guy.
What are you talking about?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
What do you mean?
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Yes, darling.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
At the old house with the voice.
I got my wish anyway.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
Amy's been lying again.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
I'll show you.
I didn't forget.
It was just a voice.
Voices from an old dark house!
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Yes, darling.
No.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
A princess?
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
This is more fun than just pretend.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
Will you come soon?
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Who is she?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Yes...yes, that's true.
Good night...Barbara...

And Amy mailed them?
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
Yeah but they looked cool...
Never felt better.
I mean where on your body?
It's not just in my head.
Nearly four.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Does she have PMS?
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
So don't look in his eyes.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
It is so hot in here.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
What? Why'd you do that?
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Check out what I found.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
So what do I do?
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
About Mark? Carlton?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
They say sex is great for cramps.
Knock what off?
Yes I do have to pee!
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
So pee? Here?
Since when do you care?
You never say that.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Yeah?
On your desk.
Your desk.
Very well then. Is that all?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Oh my god, by wolves?
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
No. I was doing my laundry.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
I love you too.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
She's just so... pathetic.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Tell her I'm eating.
Why would you want to be a cop?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Like a vampire or some shit?
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
What makes her think that?
What of?
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I see...
Sorry, sir.
Good.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Who?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
What is that door?
It must be a closet or something.
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
I'm nothing then.
Maybe.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
No more than the usual.
And we're going away for a holiday.
I promise.  I won't.
... Alright.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
Exactly. A condition.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
He was only doing his job.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Choices?
You could buy it on payments.
That'd be great.
A teleprompter.
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
Does it make the cars any better?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Certainly.
What do you mean?
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
We'd like to hire you.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
The Vice-President...
I'm outta here.
I don't understand.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I don't mind.
Oh... Okay.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
What?
You find people jobs?
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Hi.
I know.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Leave him.
Look.
Come on.
The tunnel.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
Quiet!
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
The hospital? 
Maybe.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
No, sir.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Well, no shit, Sherlock
I don't think they're in school.
Knox Overstreet.
Women swoon!
At Chet Danburry's house.
Except sex.
Garden?
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
I couldn't stop myself.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
That's not my fault.
It's Nuwanda.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
No.
What good will that do?
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
The pleasure is mine.
Sort of.
Huh?
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
My Word
Courtyard?
Yawp!
YAWP!
AHHHHHH!
A madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Okay.
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Yeah.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
Then you can help him.
Good luck.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
What is it?
Todd Anderson.
My brother went here.
Nothing.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
A play, dummy.
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
what?
No thanks.
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
Which question is that?
Who asked any?
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Shut up!
I told you...
Did you clear this?
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
On the side!!
Right... You have a boat.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
How do you know that?
You should talk...
What?
Right...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't take orders at all.
You ain't giving the orders here!
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Joey...
Where is everybody?
A passenger...
Maybe plans changed...
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
What is it man?
She fucked me.
I know...
Damn right!
John,we're going huntin'.
I'll get it! Where is it?
They did not!
Yeah.
She does not!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
You mean...?
Where? Where is he?
What hospital is he in? Where?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
No.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Where is he???
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Nick, she won't say why.
Here.
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Sure.
I don't know.
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Right here.
I don't know.
C'mon. I've got the car.
Playing.
Right here.
From Nam?
Pow.
Hell no!
It's ahead, Vince.
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
What do you mean?
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have 'em.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
Nick. Hey. How's things?
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Phantom Mary?
Naw.  Uh-huh.
Never one.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Down.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Kimberly!
Avon Lady!
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
That wasn't your plan, was it?
He could be brought back.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.

Doucet killed my partner.
Technothugs.
How do you know?
My insurance won't cover it.
Yes.
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
Drop it.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Good night.
Simulated one.
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
We're partners, aren't we?
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
I'm signing off.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
What's it mean?
From over the mountain --
No -- that's for me to do.
Jabez! Careful --
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
He lied to me again.
I didn't.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
I did not, Grandma.
Howdy, Hank.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Opportunities?
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Well, I'll be -- 
The seventh day of April --
I'm through with you.
About what?
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
There's no joy in it for me.
Shall we?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
We can still use my butter money.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Oh -- Jabez.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Jabez!
All right, Jabez ...
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
I say -- it don't matter.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Of course not --
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
It's okay, it's okay.
But meant her moving here.
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Mind if I play some tunes?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
John.
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
When you're hot, you're hot.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Two?  Are you sure?
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I still feel like shit.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Well, how'll I get home?
It's okay... it's okay...
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Well...
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
Well, then...
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
They're okay.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
I frisk you?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
It's all we got.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
They look like good kids.
I'm sorry.
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Howard!
What about Howard?
It was on the TV.
Yeah.
You stopped?  Why?
You're serious!
Let's go, Sonny.
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
Get 'em in the vault!
What?
But I want to know what you think.

What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
Wyoming.
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
Have him walk in backwards.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
Okay.  Which one goes?
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
I said you were never a faggot.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Oh.  Run.
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
On a raid. If she wants to see justice... we gonna take Domino to the Jungle, baby. <b> EXT. JUNGLE -- NEXT </b> The El Camino pulls into the entrance to the JUNGLE. The neighborhood of LOW INCOME HOUSES winds upward into the HILLSIDE adjacent to the wall. Ed parks the El Camino next to the curb. <b> INT. EL CAMINO -- NEXT
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
That's the rumor on the street.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Nice to see you again, Edna.
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Be kind to your sitter.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Must you use that awful word?
Stop it.
I said stop it.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Hello?
Do you know where Danang is?
We should sign her to a talent holding deal. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT
Real fast.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
Have you noticed something about them?
So, in other words, you are not down.
Jade, I still love you.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
Boycott Sal's.  Boycott Sal's.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
You're welcome.
Is it a good morning?
I didn't.
Yo, I'm gone.
He's completely innocent.
I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
And move to Long Island...
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Look at that.
What is?
That's my name.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
What?
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Where we goin'?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
When?
Come in then.
Your memory is really getting bad.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
Trust me.
Meda.  Meda.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
To get my money.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Sez who?
You listening to me?
Tell Vito.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Too many pizzerias already there.
'Bout time, Pop.
Tell Pino.
Whaddup?
Don't start on me today.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
HARRY Dunne.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I'm fine.
Coming.
What? No! Look.
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Well la de da.
Right.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
I go to school where I live.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
You're it.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
Who's Captain Rob?
Peg leg?
Exactly! A pirate!
You're not my real dad.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
Put some ice on it.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
Some what?
Yes.
HARRY!
Who?
No. Look.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I lugged it all over town!
But I ate your Mom's pie.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
And with that complete loser
That's the one I wanted.
Hey, where'd you go?
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll talk to you later.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Tomorrow night?
Oh, go on.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
Me too. I'm almost there.
Looks like the best man won.
You were born free and free you should remain.
Do we have a deal?
Uh-oh. Harry?
He passed away three years ago.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
Yes you are. 
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
Yes?... How was your journey?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
I'm ready.
No.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Stop him, Jessica!
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
No.  I never drink -- wine.
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Goulash.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Eddie, you screwed up.
So why didn't you do it?
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
This is kind of a stream--
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
We'll do our best.
Ed, it was only one review.
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
I thought he was dead.
This is my way of telling you --
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Raising money is tough.
Would that work?
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
Yes?
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
There's still a sex-change --
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Okay?
Bela died.
Well you tried --
Dynamite --
Lines around the block.
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Yes!
YES!  JUST DO IT!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
I'm directing.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
No! Do they show you having sex?
At what point?
Anything good?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
This is real, Bananahead!
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
Excuse me.
Um, yeah -- thanks.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
This guy.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Who?
Right.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
He made a mistake.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Mm.
Oh my God!!
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Why? How...
But Al is your husband now!
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
No, I mean...
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Never would be plenty.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Who's in it?
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
The what?
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
What?
Screw off.
I don't know.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Yeah?!
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
What's the dif --
You watching the ballgame?
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Please!
Save it.
Ray, come an--
Me?!
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
No problema.  You want a picture?
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Ed... I'm sorry.
What...
Thanks... That's ...
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No.
Sure.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
That's the point -- this could change things.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Thank you.
Yeah, just --
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
Yeah?
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Yes, I do.
Thanks, Mr. M.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
As far as I know, they--
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Take as much room as you want
Oh yeah, you bet.
Sure.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Should we get a what?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Still clear?
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
I'm not like you.
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
So?
I know.
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Yeah.
What's it to you?
Till 19-fucking-70.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
It's Bud.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
This business, Captain?
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
How?
Of course... But how?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
What are you talking about?
Get the fuck away from me.
Lynn.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
At least not anymore.
<u>Lynn</u>.
Against your code?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
Clean?
Someone must've pulled the records.
Say what and so what.
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
Say what?
Gone.  Not a trace.
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
And?
Answer yes or no.
White's a mindless thug.
His blood's always up.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Why?
What's this all about, lad?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
What?
Just don't shoot me.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
What?
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
What's Dudley's scheme?
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
I just called it.
Please hold, Sergeant...
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Nothing.
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Who are you calling?!
Turn on CNN.
Do it!
Be careful, Danny.
Told by whom?
Who was that other guy?
You're crazy.
Yeah.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
One-twenty.
I called my wife!
You told me no calls.
How do you know so much?
Jesus.
Looks like Detroit.
You sure?
We're not gonna hurt you.
No he won't.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
What if--
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
Well then who can?
Law enforcement?
You got any money?
Can you help me?
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
What kind of trouble.
I'm not his attorney.
Because I don't know.
Yes sir.
Right.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
It's okay.
How could you let me find out like this?
Just reporters.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Well...yeah.
You opened the thing?
That was for Christmas.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
Sir?
Don't count on it.
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
Oh.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Yes.
Who's doing this?
Will you hang on just a second.
For the last four years.
We're screwed.
You have to.
I <u>did</u> care how.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
We believe he did.
--otherwise we may have to--
Oh, well, that's true.
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
Can I open 'em up?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Did they take your clothes?
What about jewelry?
Table 122?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Into what?
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Jesus.
You're tired.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Yeah.
I honestly don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
What the hell does it mean?
Fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
There was a transfer.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Lyle?!
You're kidding me.
So they know everything.
What's your ETA?
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
No.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Excuse me?
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Her or me?
I do not.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
I believe you still have my book.
Good.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
There you have me.
Appropriate?
Could I trouble you for some water?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Right.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Shut-up!
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
No.
You were in Africa?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Ask him.
I don't know what that means.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
For?
I see.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Off with his head!
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
What?
To arm-twisting.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Really?  That's sudden.
No!

The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Is something funny?
Yes, for your hair.
Yes.  Later.
Kip… I -
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
He can't even move.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Does he have to go?
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
I'm feeling old.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I don't think so.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
Why?  Are you German?
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Through a window.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Then don't.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
I sincerely hope so.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
Well, no...but...
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
I never carry...baggage.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
In a week.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
It was perfect.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
No. It's a down payment.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
It was a long time ago.
It's---beautiful.
Thank you.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
I've got something for you.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
The Mask.
It's your mistake.
You don't know the half of it.
I always knew you'd do the job.
My job, my rules.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
And the money goes--
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
You've thought of everything.
Packed.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
FUCKING THING!!!
You can do it.
No way.
Get out of here!
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You gave them the eight billion.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Yes it does.
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
You're a lawyer?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
Yeah.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Show me the document that proves that.
You didn't care about my case?
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
And, what, I'm not serious?
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Uh-huh.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Say you were wrong.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
You see your office?
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
I don't know.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
We'll see.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
Ten?
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Better safe than sorry.
Thanks for reminding me.
What do you mean?
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
I can't leave my job, George.
Mm-hm.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
Have you been logging on?
What?
Uh-huh?
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Much anger in him, like in his father.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
I feel The Force.
What's wrong with him?
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
What happened?
Howls.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
What was it?
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Would you please stop calling me that?
That's quite a compliment.
You're going to attack them?!!!
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Here ... near the Anoat system.
Never heard of that system.
A mining colony.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Let's go.
I've never seen it fail.
I thought I was in good shape.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They suggested oranges.
He's a gorilla.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
What?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
I'd like to get out but I don't have enough money.
Not anymore.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
What's the little black box do?
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
So what does this thing do?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Lock fuel rods.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
So where's Plissken?
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Where'd they go?
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
The what?
Sewers. Come on.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Yeah.
I cannot--
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
So be it, to the death.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Of Merlin?
Speak of the devil!...
But not from your destiny.
...of course...
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
Ye...
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
There is one.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
I will run.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Hi, how'd your day go?
What's this?
What didn't he tell you?
I can't believe it.
What is it?
No, she was heavily sedated.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
I just heard them Karl.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Fine thank you.
Why the math?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Never.
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
Convulsion?
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
No I didn't know you had one.
No.
He didn't mention her.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Could you see her?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
No.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Father?
Um........Stuff.
You like it?
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
I wouldn't talk.
I don't know
Do you not like him like daddy?
How do you know?
Okay.
St. Mike's.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
Okay.
So what's wrong with her?
So what's next?
Oh, Christ.
I stole it.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
Who's in it?
I've seen it.
Intensely.
In time.
Holy water.
No.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
In the face of the enemy.
Amen
And also with you.
Defender of the human race...
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I've seen him.
Unlikely.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Is that a threat?
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
O'Lord hear my prey.
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Your pay.
It's all there.  Both nights.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Swimming trunks.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
No bones?
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
How's the birthday girl?
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
How we doing?
Jack...
Fuck him.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
You got weird kids, Frank.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
It's more than that.
No thanks.
Says who?
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
Talk.
It's early.
She'll get here.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
She's here.
How about these?
I'll take my chances.
You wanna get a drink?
Two years ago.  March.
Last?
Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Right.
Yeah.
Christ, can't you hear it?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Fine.
Two hours ago!
What the hell are these?
What?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
He was just having fun.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
This'll kill 'em.
The flu.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Don't take it personally.
You're an hour and a half late.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
When we know.
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's wrong with it?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Uh... good.
Right.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Smells like fish.
Yeah.
Tell her.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
Thanks, Lloyd.
I'll call you.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Nothing personal --
It's okay.  Last one.
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Hey, business is business.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Huh?
No kidding?
He called her.
You're kidding.
There's always another girl.
I didn't want to wake you.
What are they?
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
He's losing his teeth.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
Yeah -- me.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
Only one you've never broken.
It's important.
And you wouldn't be.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Don't hang up ...
Jon, what is it?
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
I won't tell mom if you don't.
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
Who did?
Like what?
Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Is it...?
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
Hey, is that really necessary?
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
All in one tape?
Yeah...fine.
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
And...?
It’s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  I’m gonna buy it...
She got those shoes...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
If you want to look at it that way...
Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Think bigger.
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Look, you’re making this into something it’s not. This isn’t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It’s a step forward...  Don’t you see?  I’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
Are you okay, Jack?
Promise me again...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Merry Christmas...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Yes!
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Youthful high spirits.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Oh, he did.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
Ben!  Ben!
Oh, it is.
I can go hotter!
Right, whatever, have fun.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
That's what we're here to find out.
And reverse the mutations --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Just <u>find</u> him.
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
Oh, I think you already have.
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
I'd hold that off awhile.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
It's only for an hour --
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
Yes, Cora.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
You left something out.
The Breath of God...
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
At an operation?
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
If there's any chance --
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
That line was tampered with...
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Looks simple to operate.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
What's this, sir?
I don't think so. It's nice.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
No.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Personal matters.
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Now we had a deal here! A deal's a deal!
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
Oh, he's adorable.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Mr. Mohra?
Officer Olson.
Uh-huh - in what way?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Mm.
Uh-huh... A what?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Oh, yah?
Uh-huh.
Uhn.
Hold on.
Yah, right -
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
You bet.
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
...Babe the Blue Ox?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yah, okay.
Okay.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Well, they -
The heck d'ya mean?
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Call 'em up.
Nope.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Yah?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Just a Diet Coke.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Well, they're a good outfit.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
I always liked ya so much...
Anyone else residing there?
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Yah, is this Marge?
Margie Olmstead?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
- looking.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Yah, ya think?
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
He's at Norstar.
Well -
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Who do you think could've done this?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
I'll expose you.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
The girl had done her homework.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
Marla?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Please.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Here.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Don't ask.
Yes.
Who's this?
Who do you think I am?
My suitcase was vibrating?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
Do what you like.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
This is crazy.
Like hell.  That counted.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
I said I promise!
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
A liposuction clinic.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
Look at your hand.
We don't... ?
You quit?
Work.  Going to work.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Homework assignment.
Nothing.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Why do people think I'm you?
I don't know!  Tell me!
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
What... what are you saying?
I'm not going...
Stop finishing...
If you know, I know.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Why what?
What have you left for me?
What?
You told me you'd say that.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
No!
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
There is no money.
Yes, it is.
You and your friend.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
How'd you know?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Taken care of.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
...My Premonition was just like his.
I'm not following you --
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How do you know?
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Sure.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Yeah?
Nice try, kiddo.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Right. April 25th.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
No!
You're the fuckin' devil.
In Death...
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
That's what I'm doin'!
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
There's a compass in the handle.
No.
Yeah...
Powerful warrior.
I need a vacation.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
I thought he was with you.
Spooks?
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Nguyen is good boy.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
What's the plan?
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
What?
About 22 hours on site.
Colonel.
I could take it or leave it.
But now it's free, right?
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
No, I'm fine... really...
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
Okay.  ... I love you...
What does that mean?
Well, what the hell does that mean?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
No...  He is supposed to live there?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
Yes... I... I agree...
You can ask.
No, I have to work.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
How much?
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
<u>What</u>!?
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
But I can't get it... He's...
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
Who?
It's a classic.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Sure...
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
You advise us!
No just Parry.
I don't like horror movies!
You don't have to say that.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Out where?
You got another ball comin'.
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
What the hell is that?
Who said I was depressed?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Okay...
What?
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
No.
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Are you talking to us?
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
Hi, Tita.
You know who it once belonged to?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
Don't tell me about this...
I know.
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Uhm hmm.
Yeah, well, he's...
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
Thank you.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
That's what you said?
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Just give me a chance, will you?
At game, Carl.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
That's an old maid's tale.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Hold onto this.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Well, she was.
Yes.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Why you have an attitude for?
So get the fuck outta here.
Just get the fuck outta here.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Is it true?
Wussup.
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
Of course.
You look good.
I can't!
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
C'mon.
She didn't say she had no man.
Your friend must be misinformed.
I'm a good friend of hers.
Yeah.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
That's Babar.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
You don't know me.
Affirmative.
Gum thought Brazil.
Where am I?
Thank you.
That's it?
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
You may be right.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Whoops.
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
What's that?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Why not?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Who?
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Where am I going?
They serve dinner on the flight?
You sure those doors will be open?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Deal.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Don't say shoot, okay.
I'm sorry?
Cute thing.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Hi.
I saved his life during the war.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
He never sees them and I never met them.
What is this?
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
What does all this mean?
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Act natural.
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
Come here.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Sierra del fuego.
What?
She moved out.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Uh, almost.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I don't know.  Look!
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
What about finding the source?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
What...
My secretary.
John!
In a minute!
Who's your decorator?
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Right away!
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Johnny's C.D.?
You gave it to the girls for one.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Fluck you!
Why are all these people after me?
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
No, wait...
Ye-ah.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
Who's my real father, man?
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Ciao.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
That's funny, you're cute.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
What?
Doyle.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Boca?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn't looking.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's yours too!
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Encore du sho ping!
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
S'right.
You're for real?
Where from?
Yeh?  Who else?
Who's on him?
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Give who a tail?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
Suspicion of what?
Let yourself in.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Pour it in your ear.
We put him to bed for the night.
Four.
What is that old building?
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
You remember Mary Finelli?
Nothing.
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Don't know what's behind it.
Sure.
Wish you weren't.
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
No.  This isn't what you think.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Uh, huh.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
How's that?
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
W...B...2...YXB.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What if it's not...
Yeah...I think so.
I lost you.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Yeah, I think so...
John, he's got my driver's license.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
In my pocket.
Dad, you there?
What's wrong?
Sully!  Is that you?
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
Better.
Huh?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Yeah.  Sure.
Sounds good.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I don't know...
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
Somebody was in here.
You promised you'd never ask me.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I have to.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Happy Friday the 13th.
My ass.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
No.
'Cause it stinks.
Come and get it.
There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
I found it outside.
We'll scare 'em right back.
But what I get scared again?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Boy scouting.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
There's no time for this bullshit...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
The what?
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
Not so bad, today.
Do you have to ask?
Okay.
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
I'm now begging you.
Okay.
You don't know shit!
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
-- Bad?!
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Yeah.
Nothing.
No.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
You're telling a lie.
I'm staying.
She didn't push me into coming.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
There's something I haven't told you...
I gathered that.
What is your location?
We changed our minds.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
What do you mean???
The window...
What do you mean, we must abandon?
What do I exude?
That was a big mistake.
It's your best play, Nicky.
What are you talking about?
You know about Adele.
She's dying.
Can he get through it?
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Daddy, wait.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Yes.
Who the hell cares?
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
I'm at the door.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
You know the answer to that.
They're only gonna lose.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
My back is killing me.
I can't find it.
I lost it. I lose everything.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Because God loves a winner.
Why do you care?
You're out of bullets.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
I have excellent long-term memory.
What color?
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
I don't know.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
Well, we shall try.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
He said he's in charge...
A -- a week.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
It was one incident.
Panditji -- please, help me.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
A great deal.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
I --
I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
That's when you take advantage.
That was England.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
I dined at the prison.
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
Blood.  From the vein.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
Where did you get this?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
Any particular reason?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Not bad, Jerome.
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
In case you get back before I do.
I hope he's not just a body.
That's the hair color in his profile?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
How tall are you?
Why not?
Of course.
Those checks take forever.
Let's walk.
Come on.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
We could go together one day.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
There's a problem, Lamar.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
Antonio--
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
Stay clean.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Whisky and a peach.
Just the way I remembered.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
After four years and now the question comes up.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
You were asleep.
I couldn't have... much longer.
Want to cry now?
Usually on the right side as you go in.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
There are three men dead.
You sent me to him.
You bastard...
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Sure...
Whatever happens it's over.
You want to try with me?
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Oh my God.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
What about you?
What about the vault?
He took the day off.
Can't leave the desk.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
You serious?
I Just want to find a suitcase.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
I'll tell you when.
I know.
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
Yeah.
Was the steering faulty?
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
What name?
Why?
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
No.
Was he?
Brumby.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Especially when I play the lead.
Expect so.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
I left last year.
Yes.
No.
At me friend's house.
Yes.
How'd you find me?
Oh yes? How?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
My brother, Frank.
Ta-ra.
No.
Jack Carter.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
Sod off.
Yeah.
We've got to take you back to London.
But they have to be diplomatic.
That's right.
To get on the...
Eh?
No.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Eh?
Himself?
What hard part?
You...
When they...
Yes...?
What? 
Yes.
Yes.
No.  Not actually.
Have I said that?
Did you talk to Graff?
What did he say?
What will he pay?
You're saying "me."
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
...what am I going to do all month...
No.
I was at home, where were you?
Was I?
No, who?
No.
You...
Thank you, George.
We had a robbery. 
In school.
That they're going to be upset.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
...you didn't close...
Not lately it isn't.
Murray...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
You know what those leads cost?
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
The leads are assigned randomly...
I can't do it, Shel.
And what if you don't close.
Twenty percent.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Now.  Yes...When?
I can't split them.
You want something off the B list?
The deal still stands, our other thing.
The leads are coming.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
What does that fucking mean?
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Who kept the other half?
Was it?
Mmm.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
I'm sorry.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Last night, this morning.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
Like you taught me...
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Home cooking...
Twelve-fifteen.
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth.
Mm.
I don't know.
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
To change our minds.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
I...
I...
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
And the check is...
You did that?
Guess who?
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
No, where is it?
Just a few days.
We have no money for a rug.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
I got surprises for everybody!
Connie.
I saw him with you.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
No.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
Not for strangers; for my country.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
I've always taken care of you.
It's the way Pop wanted it.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Beautiful.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
I'm going to see my parents.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
Yes.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
Sure, Mikey.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Mike, at three and a half...
It was a boy.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
I know he's in Israel.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Twenty-five this time.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
He is, I believe, a brother.
Sleeping inside me.
Right here.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Some water.
Turnbull is a good man.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
We got friends in the commission.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
What was that?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Weird.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
You liked it too.
I'm not a kid.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
No!
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
What do I do?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
But I didn't do this!
I stink to high heaven right now.
What?  Oh yes.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
What was wrong?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
That's exactly what I intend to do.
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
What?
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
Do you miss it?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
You were a soldier?
Clayton is fine.
If that's okay?
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Good.  Let's get dry.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
A very lucky thing indeed.
I'm very sorry.
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Good.  Fine.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Of course.  This afternoon.
A visitor.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Who do you think?
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
I knew you'd say that.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
What do you mean -- ?
Get out of here, then. Now.
You know my back.
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Castlebeck.
Good.
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Hey, Donny --
Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
Gray.
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
It's arright ...
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
Yes, sir -
You guys are through...
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Yeah... You want a ride...
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hello, Memphis --
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Yeah --
Hey, now -
I can handle it --
Otto called -
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
Nah.
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
I don't know. What -- ?
I know ...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Thought I'd go for a ride -
It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
Hey -
What's wrong with her -- ?
That what you want?
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No way ...
Wrong preposition...
What about The Club ... ?
And Tracy's on the move ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
What's that?
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
Are you considering a comeback tour?
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Checkin' it out
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
I understand.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
I'm in construction.
What are you gonna do?
I can't do it anymore.
With what?
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
You know. The stuff I left.
I got scared.
Yeah. What about the kids' school?
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Yeah.
Will you stop.
He heard.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Yeah.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
I don't want them left back.
That's important.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
What? Come on!
Oh shit.
Suck my cock!
Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--
Fuck you.
No, and we got four of 'em.
I don't know yet.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Why not?
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Ah, history I think.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
I wanted to meet your brothers...
How you doin'?
This is your house, right?
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
I told you, I just got change.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
I have about seventy-three...
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
Seven.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
--But--
Yeah, can I help you?
An integer.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Hey, how you doin'?
I appreciate that.
Yes.
Pleasure to meet you.
I did.
I've been busy.
It's on the college.
Tom.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
I won't talk first.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
"Undermine?"
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
He's not you!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
There is somebody...
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Hold up.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Have you read all these books, Will?
What did you think?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
This is a real piece of shit.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Time's up.
You've never been out of Boston.
I don't know.
Haven't called her.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
You're kiddin' me.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
Okay, sounds good.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Your house must have been a zoo.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
How the hell did you do that?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
All right, all right. We'll go.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
And you're sure about that?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
What am I scared of?
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Joe!
But ain't no reason--
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
People done it. If they could, we could.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Fan-belt's shot.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Got a warrant?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Crate fell on me.
Yeah. On my way home now.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Have a little snort?
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Just around that next bend.
I never heard nothin' about it.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
Want to work, do you?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Yeah.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
You been acrost?
This here's a strike.
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
California.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
Okay. I be back a little later.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Ya say we're acrost?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Won't they come out here?
Me an' you both.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
We gonna take whatever they got.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
What?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Here is now there. There is here.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Well, there's not much to tell.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Okay... Hold on...
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Like love?
I'm staying here.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
I don't think so.
--Nooo--
It was the PLO.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
That's too bad.
See you in ten years.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
All by yourself?
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
A jogger, huh?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Need a lift?
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Feel good?
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
I am comfortable.
Okay.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
What?
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Don't they believe in signs here?
Why? There's no food in the house?
Well, one was for salad...
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
What?
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
So do you.
Who's there?
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Yeah. Bye.
Tch. What are you --
No, let me go.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
About what?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Yes, it does.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
You know her?
Yeah.
We should be fine, then.
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
It's cool!
Alright sir.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
The sensitive type.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Again?  Yeah sure.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
That's far out!
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
It was him, man!
Difficulty rating?
Cereal.
Dead?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Hmmm.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
How did you know that?
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Okay. Let's go shopping.
Yeah! Sure.
I said give me time.
What?
Are you challenging me?
I know, I know who wrote it.
I'll make it up to you!
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
My name is the Plague.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Virus?
What, it left a note?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Thank you.
Real charmer.
All right.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Okay sure. What about?
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Michael Myers.
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
How many people in the bus?
I can't sleep.
Like a sister?
Double scoops?
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
I can't.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Hi Jamie.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
No problem, Sheriff.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
He's here, Sheriff.
He's been here.
Least I'm not alone.
Yes.
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Now you understand?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
Huh?
He shouts, too.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Look where?
Okay. Bye.
Of course.
Bye.
I wasn't spooked.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
He was watching me.
Thanks.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
And I can't keep you interested?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Michael's around someplace...
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
He isn't a man.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
Totally.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Have a good time.
Same time, same place.
Sure.
Sure. Sure.
There is no such thing.
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
Yes.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
I can't believe it!
You want to see some?
Uh --
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Okay.
No, he called late last night.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Right.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
We're actresses.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
It's terrific!
Yeah.
Yes.
Oh, okay.
This time I really think I have something.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Hi.
Could you--
...cannot go on the air.
I don't know exactly.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
You're out looking here?
Ohhhh!
Oh.  Well, I live--
Yes, I do.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Yes?
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Well, sure.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Why, you know the situation.
Not because of me, I hope.
Why?
I can't say anything!
I didn't sleep all night.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
No.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Are you angry with me?
Always.
Oh, honey!
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
Absolutely.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Yeah.
They're in the basement.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Who is it?
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Jesus...Jesus!
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Hello?
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Okay.
Why?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
I think so.
Football!
Wow!
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Two thousand dollars.
Uh-oh.
She really does, though.
I should get a garter belt.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
He's not a loser at all!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh?
Look, everything's going your way.
So what's new?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Well-well, like what?
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
You want some?
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Oh, no.
Yeah?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Yeah.
Oh, well.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, who cares?
Oh, yeah?  What?
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Okay.
Just a few minutes ago.
April?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
...I was <u>working</u>...
I hereby acknowledge that...
It's a growth business.
Say it in English.
You want me to be?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
...the whole world's out to get you...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
They got that kind of money?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
You take this much time over everything?
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
...Let's see the pigs, please.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
I won't take much of his time.
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Exactly.
Mmm...
I can make you rich.
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Let the girl go.
Shut up, Starling...
...what'm I looking at...?
...standard issue...
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
I don't <u>think</u> so...
I said sometime it gets so...
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
A wonderful country...
...should love to correct your error. 
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Why did you look at me that way?
...your <u>scar</u>..?
Enchante.
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Is it necessary to know?
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Sir, with all due respect....
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
...what has she done to harm you...?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...<u>what</u>...?
....because we don't have any mmm...
Hey, lost again.
Brazilian. 
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
I don't understand.
Yes.
...why?
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because?
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
What are you gonna do about it?
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]

Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Don't get cocky, girl.
No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
Because you're an idiot.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Yeah, I just got back.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
I don't really like your friends either.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.

You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Really? Do tell.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
What's the occasion?
What's the difference?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
But... I thought...
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
This isn't happening.
Really? Why?
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
I don't work here.
Two.
This game is over do you hear me?
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Allen?  He... he's okay?
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Were you in it?  In the war?
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Uh, no.
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Vietnam!
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
Bodybuilding!
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
Unprofessional.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
She can't quit.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
What?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Let's watch some TV.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
-- a sense of proportion.
Who doesn't?
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
It's a living.
I think we should talk first.
I'm thirsty.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
Oh -- great.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
Did you lock the garage door?
He wasn't there.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
What for, dickweed?
Put it out, man!
Do you have enough money?
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
I have a cold.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Really.
Not now.  I'm busy.
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
What is it?
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
We don't have any proof of that.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Central Park.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Around.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
What?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Leaving what?
If it came down to it what would you do?
Living.  Remember?
She's the King's cousin.
What worries you?
No.  What am I to do?
No -- after you.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
Why not?
I cannot explain.
Aye.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
What do you want?
A lucky guess.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Because it's my name.
New York is dangerous place.
You look like you have.
You're twenty minutes late.
I wanted to get to know you better.
No.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
Not unless they're immortal.
Get out.
What?  How?
I know, Paul.
This cannot be.
It will not end tonight.
I can take care of myself.
Me too.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Fine.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Yes, sir.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
It was stolen.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?
He knows better than that.
You won't die if you let me help.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
I'm not going to die for this!
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Use more ice.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
I got the gasoline --
I don't know.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
What hospital?
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
Shh, they'll hear you!
How about dog shit?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
Just one question.  Please.
Another minute.  Please --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Order your men to stand down.
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
Yes, sir.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
Where's the office?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
Can you get into the office?
Yes, sir.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
We, who is we?
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
What's happening?
Canadian Club?
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
And what will they do with these satellites?
The high command? Our high command?
Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
You said you had no whiskey.
I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
Whiskey?
I'll be over.
No, sir.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Business is good at the hotel?
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
What is it?
Oh my God!
Thank God.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
I saw the sign.
Promoted. House Manager.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Why sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
What cards?
I will see what I can do.
How do you know?
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
Homework?
Please, be quiet.
We must do something.
I sent them home. Go and call them.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Stay with the children.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
In Ruhengeri?
What?
I will follow on the next plane. Go.
Please do not talk like this.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
He has taken the presidential suite.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Thank you, Roger.
What is his room number?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
So what stopped her?
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Oh dear.
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
And I think that's case --
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
Did it work?
The...Fourth of July.
It's not going to let us out!
-- yeah, we did that --
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
-- that's the fact, bud --
That's crazy!
Jesus!
I hope not.
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Where is she?
I can't remember at the moment.
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
What?
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Blackburn's dead.
Keep talking, I'll find you!
What's the matter?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
No!
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
I don't understand.
Maybe it was Colleen...
No it won't - no it won't!
She talks to me.
We'll get it later.
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Take me to her.
Don't be afraid!
Whatever you say.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Should I...
I'm ok.
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
What!
So what should we do, father?
And you...are?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Well what is it!
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
Right.  Right!
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
And he still sits there?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
A prize?  For what?
No.  Really?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
But how in God's name ...
Not quite.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Gum.
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
"But we'll be the same as we started...
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Last rites, sister?
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Oh, I'm so sorry...
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
I don't care.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
Yes.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
Sharp.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
I'm plenty happy!
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
I myself --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Oh, no, really, I --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
You know, on farm route 17.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Oh Norville, I --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Phony, huh?
He grins wolfishly.
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
...Geez.
But, buddy --
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I haven't had --
You --
Oh my God, sir!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Old Faithful.
...Her mother needs an operation...
He don't look wise.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
Where?
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Wait. I want to listen.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
Of course not!
And charming?
I often do.
You didn't drive her mad.
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
To the asylum?
And as usual no one believed me...
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
You think I --
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Yeah.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
What?
I just can't believe you could be so --
Good night kiddo.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Hi Wendy.
With Mikey?
We were just riding around.
It's not a bother.
It's not like we're too busy.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Um, Libbets Casey.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
You going to tell dad?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
I don't have a girlfriend.
I dunno. I --
I don't know.
Huh?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Can I come?
With who?
What are you doing?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
That's all, for now.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
But there wasn't any...
Yeah.  All over.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
I told her to come.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
That's right.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
What are we thinking?
Habit.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
What is it?
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Ran like hell to go to him...
You're not missing much.
That's what I said.
Yes.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
He.  Well, he...
Told you I could write an ending.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
You mean we are not children of Satan?
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
You said there were none.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
I didn't realise.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Does it?
Is that supposed to frighten me?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
What have you done?
He jests.
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Yes.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
Be still!
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Then my luck would have changed.
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Dying?
Paris? You came from Paris?
You finish her - if you feel so much -
What are you saying?
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
You're not lying to me, are you?
Can a vampire feel love?
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
It's over, I'm telling you...
Yes...
My daughter...
Is that bad?
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
What are you doing in my closet?
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
No, I'm the King of the World.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Yes.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Then, we fight --
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
It's okay.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
I'm okay.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
He's in it with Willis?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Rio, baby!
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
No. I shot him.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
So why are you still here?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
May life be good to you both. As for the others —— they will be quiet here —— and I will be with them.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
My friend -- what can one say --
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I was looking for you.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then —- I'll not die —— I'll watch -— they shall not hurt you.
Thea is an orphan.
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
My last name is Pherides.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
That should decide it or you --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
Really, this is idiotic!
I don't understand you.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Her family name?
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Then foreclose!
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
All right –– all right.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No, of course not.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
They went out of business years ago.
I know. I know.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Mother . . .
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Uh-huh.
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
All in . . .
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Uh-huh.
No.
Ummmm . . .
Oh, George.
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh . . .
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
She was here first.
Hello, Vi.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Right down here.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
I'd like to do that.
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Neither am I.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Do you like it?
Well, then, sit down.
Thank you.
Please, let's not stop, George.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
To keep from being an old maid.
Left them at the office.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
I've eaten.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
Someone pop your balloon?
Swim for it!
Is she responsible for the punch?
I hope that's the cousin.
Yeah.
Yee-hah!
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Over here!
Happy to do it.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
Got it.
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Hey, come on....
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Me neither.
What's that supposed to mean?
After we've looked, we'll talk.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Home it is.
As far as the office.
What're you guys doing today?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
For me?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Mike's out there.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
That's what he said.
Now I really want to see it.
It's all right, we're okay.
I will, I will.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
Shut up.
Huh?
Double nope!
And second?
Is there something I don't know about?
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
I can go out if I want to.
Name it.
Sean, baby, please....
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Coming about, then.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Len, can I see you a minute?
What the hell is he doing?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
With those camera lights and...
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
And a missing man.
What is it, 97 days?
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Just put your mask on.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Make up your mind.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
What's that?
No, you're not.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
Okay.
Sure.  Let's go.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Fine.  Have them do some.
Yes, aren't we all.
I thought they were clever.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
No!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
We're taking that shark alive!
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Still sleeping.
Should be coming out of it soon.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Thanks to you.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
Ten minutes ago.
Sure.
He's missing.
Yeah, from Boston.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Why you sonuvabitch...
I don't know, what else is there?
It's okay, Sean.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Don't you dare.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
What?
It's disappeared.
Hey.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Polar bears in Georgia???
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
Right, Mike.
All right, hit those lights too.
Got a job for me?
Don't hurry back.
Watch me, Grandma....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Because....
No....
I don't know....
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
You have something to say about everything....
Stop what?
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
You can stay in my room.
It's not nice to be evasive.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I didn't.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Good.  So will I....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I'm not going to quit now....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I have to get this finished.
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
I always listen to my feelings....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
No, you're not....
A big one....
You're not going to bet it all....
I'm sorry...I....
The whole idea is preposterous....
My vision is perfect....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
I do....
You're the man who drives the plane.
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
I fly elephants for smugglers....
It needs more time to charge.
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Will you leave me alone...?
The readings suck....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
What?
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Mom....
It'll work....
When he has a pillow over his head....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Good night, Polly....
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
O.K.
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
So am I. But where's my money?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Are you sure you didn't call?
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
Hey ..
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
No.
No, Sir.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
Maybe he's lying to you?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
He ain't offerin me shit.
Why not? You heard my voice?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
No.
I don't know.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
Which is what?
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
It's not possible right now.
I wanna be near you ...
Yes, Sir.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Okay, this is working.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Look, I don't want a --
-- stop --
No.
Listen to me, it's over.
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
No no. I knew.
I just got goosebumps.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Do you have something to drink?
Good idea.  Thank you.
And I am...
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
I'm relieved you said that.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
What?
Fine, I just --
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
You want...
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
He's in the living room asleep.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thank you.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
No--
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
Very much.
Huh?
I understand your anxiety.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
No, I'm saying to be --
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
I'm a little worried --
No.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Damn right.
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
What DO you stand for???
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Funny.
What?
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
So do you.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Eric...
That one time was just the bumper.
Think.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You mean it?
I would completely support that.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
What about Eric?
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
Sure.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Something must've scared them.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
This plane can not land!
I have never been on this island!
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I don't even know this woman.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Piss.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
She's nuts.
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
What do you think they want?!
Where's Kelly?
It'll hold!
Look!  Sarah!
What's that?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Funded by whom?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Can the kid walk?
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
What now?
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
John....
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They smell.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Dilophosaurus.
Not just every six weeks.
You can't hold it by yourself!
No, no, no!
What's that?
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
Why not?
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
Anti-nature.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Thank you.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
Tim, are you okay?
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
"Thunder lizard!"
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
Nope.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Why?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Who?
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Let's get you out.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Sure.
Excellent.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
What?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Great.
That's my job.
What?
Who's chest?
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
So?
Insomnolesence...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
So what do we do?
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
I'll commit that to memory.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
You're just doing your job.
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I do.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
One of you must be mistaken.
I've never seen you here before.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
Tonight?
... All right.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Usually.
I -- I found your jailer.
-- Listen to me --
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
I don't know.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Yes.  Isn't it there?
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Native costume?
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Yes?
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Will you let me go then?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
I said yes, I see.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
No, I'm look --
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
How would I remember?
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
-- OK?
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Try some other ways. 
Not much point to this, is there?
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
When?
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
I was wondering what that was.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Trask wants to talk with you.
OK.
Can you use these?
How is it back there?
Well there's a couple --
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
All right.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
I think she's trying that.
Then how are you involved?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Ladies and gentlemen...
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
No!
Yeah?
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Dad?
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
It's my name too.
You like it?
Yep.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
No questions.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
No.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What about Billy?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
Fine.
You want what?!
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
What?
Beautiful.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Kramer...
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
I know....I know.
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Ten.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
No.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Got it.
I understand.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
What?
Again?
Cow.
Can I do anything I want?
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Are you, General?
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
I have.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
I am afraid.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Far, far away.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I miss my brother.
How many?
What do you think?
Roughly five thousand men.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
I had relinquished doubt.
Thank you.
But you will always be here?
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Pretend.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
I will miss you.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
Too young?
Oh, yes.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
It happens when I land.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
No!!  Out!
They don't really attack underwater and--
It came from across the lake.
Then do it!!
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
You ready on shore?
You talk to Bickerman?
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
No.
Could we have intercourse?
Never been to Maine before?
I <u>told</u> you.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
I'd be able to see something.
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Good.
Good.  See ya soon.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Ssssh!
You're mushing it a little around the--
You calm down!
Okay.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Keep firing!
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Good thinking.
White perch.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
Obviously I was wrong!
You talk to the married couple?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Hector thinks you like him.
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Wait.
I guess.
It's ten after nine.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Kelly--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
Kevin told me you were upset.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
He's here, Ardelia.
Where?
Get me out!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Starling -
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
That wasn't me.
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Thanks.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Not yet.
Yes sir.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Did you ever work with her?
All that detail, just from memory...?
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Then please - do this test for me.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Mmm. And what else...?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Yes...! They were screaming.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Alice?
I have nothing to go back for.
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
That is sedition! Treason!
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
We don't.
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
What did you see, Major?
By your leave, sir.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
Fire!!!
Atten-hut!
Yes sir!
Fire!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Wampum?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
This interview's over! The militia stays!
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Granted, Monsieur.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
I'm not a doctor.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What?...
What has?
Fuck your orders!
I got hung up!  Try this!
What?
Good...It's going good.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
Who cares?
He's tanking on us...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
Under there?
The infirmary?...
No fuckin' lie...
Let's hope it holds.
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
I ought to smack your face!
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
Right.
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Hardly.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Well, talk.
It's hit us all hard!
I'll think of something, don't worry.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Apart from those shotguns.
It's a Samoan pub.
Like antiques.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Yes?
Jesus Christ!
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Try that one.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
OK, open the gate.
Out the back.
Invitations?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
I'll only be a minute.
You will what?
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
For half a million?
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
I'll only be a minute.
Get your fingers out of my soup!
That's going on optimism.
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
So?
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Thank you, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Colt Peacemaker.
I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
He a Black man or an Indian?
But they were Indians themselves.
He's still pissed off about it.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Maybe.
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
You know who it was they dug up?
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
Aqui! [Here!]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
We have a daughter.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Seems like we have another one every week.
--Santiago.
Right.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Steve?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Well, you hire illegals--
I don't mean Fernando.
Okay? He's not here?
What was your deal with him?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Enough with the clothes--
I thought he busted you a couple times.
So I've heard--
They've got my Amado.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
Yeah.
I've felt that way, yeah.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Couple months before I was born--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
You'd do a good job.
You don't need to cuff me.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
Runnin' numbers illegal.
You going to tell him?
He's gonna find out.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
They go together.
Who?
Nix?
doorway) And who's that?
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
I told you --
About?
Not yet.
What is he?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
When do you want me to start?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I don't know where you'd start.
You didn't marry him for love.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Some or it.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
I think so.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
He got up and walked.
--vanished.
What about Swann's miracles?
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Shut up!
Yes.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
What's her problem?
Yes...
I don't know what else to do.
Will that do?  No?
And you believed him?
No.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
I don't know.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I got to go.  I'm late.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Ok.
No way.
Ok.
It's Charlotte.
No, I was looking at you.
You're possessive.
Where'd you grow up?
Because that would be too easy.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
Oh, she'll love it.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Yeah, look at that thing.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Bye.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Why do you have to defend her?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Claire...
I don't know.  What are they?
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Father, I'm right here.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
How many weeks are you honey/
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
I had to.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
When's your birthday?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
What did he say to you in French?
Terrific.
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We need all the help we can get.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
We millionaires yet?
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
I can't eat before a game.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
How is he?
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
Thanks, sweetheart.
This time get your feet set.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Sort of.
Huh?
Then I'll get you some punch.
Uh-huh.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Yes, we appreciate that.
No.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
How'd you get him to say yes?
Oh, great.
Yeah, right.
Just not my type, I guess.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I don't care.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Kay.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
God, here we go.
Would you watch the damn road?
He ain't Spalding.
So you took Shawnee, huh?
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
That what you think?
I know, right?
Fine, Quincy.
I said fine.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
Right here.
Quincy...
Here I am.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
The "man" again.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
I don't think so.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
A rest?
No.
Thanks.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Find.
Better late than never, right?
So you're gonna bitch up?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Well, can you give him this for me?
Business folks.
Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
What?
Tell me what?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
You want me to fuck off?
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
I don't know.
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Well what's the situation?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
No one else in there with you?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
It's fine.
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
-- do you wanna cup?
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
What's that stand for?
Good bye.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
ok.
I'm sorry.
ok.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
You don't know how crazy I am.
Yes.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
It's upstairs.
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
-- no.
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
I ain't fuckin with you --
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Gently, son --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Do you wanna sit down?
No.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
I've seen it before.
It's ok.
Twelve.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Let's talk about --
-- let's talk more about your background --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
Well I guess it doesn't.
From '84 to '89.
...this close...
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
...ok...
I don't think, he can't...
The door was open, I got a call --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
What's this, how did this happen?
I went out last night.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
Yeah.
Paula.  Ellen.
What about now?
Did you ever touch her?
I don't know what I've done.
You're her boyfriend?
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
No.
What's MOW?
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
Hi.
Water.
That's it.
What do you do?
That's pretty cool.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
Yes.
I have money.
This happens....this is something that happens.
And you were not hurt?
Nothing... Nothing.
D'Artagnan.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Shut up, knave!
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Well... Well... Okay.
What use am I?
Who?
He is right, d'Artagnan.
Who does?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Raoul --
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
I know.
Get out of my way.
I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
D'Artagnan...
Just... water.
Who came?
I decided it this morning.
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Your Majesty has had many women --
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
There.
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
Thank you, Keeper.
Raoul... is in love...
Oh Louis, Louis...
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
So what?
You mean shut your ass down!
I didn't hit shit!
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Gotta come from somewhere...
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
And he took a swing at you?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
No -
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
A bank?
Both at the same bank...
I'm going to need a way to get there.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Screw him!
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
That's when it happened?
How are Molly and the boy?
Christ!
Twenty minutes max.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
What else did you keep out of the papers?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
What do you want to do?
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
You.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Wait, Will...
No.
What's that?
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
Have him peel the top label back.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
He went to the men's room.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
The activities of nocturnal animals.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I don't want to know.
Yes.
Oh, God.
Please, no.
No.
Dr. Chilton.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Most people are.
Goodbye.
What's average?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Tell me about yourself.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I love you...
No.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Go on to the house...
Yeah...
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
No.
Huh?
I thought you would have some ideas.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
Deal.
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
No thanks.
It's me.
You don't know the real me.
Okay.  You're probably right.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
Then your father's a wimp.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
What?!?
No!  Andy, don't do it --
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
Oh.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
It's already begun.
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
And you are?
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Hear what?
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
How many were there?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
But what if...?
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
What do you know?
... Yes.
No.
The Matrix?
This can't be...
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
More important than what is when?
Show me.
Because... I didn't think I would?
Your mind makes it real.
How?
She would say she knows enough.
That's why we're here.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Good.
Yes, sir.
Do it!
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What do you mean, without him?
What?
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
What?
She told me...
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
I'm going in after him.
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
I believe I can bring him back.
Not yet.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
He's alive.
I'll be all right.
Follow me.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
You sure?
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Uh...can we give you a check?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
She don't look Jewish.
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Wouldn't bother me.
I don't like loading crates.
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
That's not going to help.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
How?
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
That bad, huh?
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
Get him in.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
We'll be here.
Fine.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
No you weren't.
Yes, you did.
Oh...around...why?
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
I know...I know.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Friends of yours Michael.
You think so?
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
He's coming.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Who?
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
'Goddam party'!
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Here...
"Death and Taxes"?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
A voice?
What?!
'Just kidding'?
How nice for you both.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
As much as Joe's?
I don't care.
I don't think so.  Do you?
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
You get not to go to jail.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Joe, you do get around.
Thanks, Quince.
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Mine, too.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Hi, Jennifer.
As long as it takes.
What do you mean 'free'?
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Watch me do what?
Be sorry for nothing.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
To bed.
I loved it.
I love you in an evening gown.
It's a saying.
Yes, that's why I said it.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
I love you now, I'll love you always --
No.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Yes?
Yes, Bill.
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Why didn't you stop me?
That's okay.
Just a manner of speaking.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
Say again?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
Does she know where she's going?
Get him in here.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
And we're very grateful.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
'...Yes --'
You fill the bill, Bill.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
You think Drew will go for it?
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
I know it's none of my business --
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Nothing.
Yer damn right.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Raise away.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
I'm sorry --
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
No --
But we've got time.
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Hi, Leonard.
This isn't my room?
Then why is this my handwriting?
Just two. So far.							  *
Who did this to you?
Interested in buying one?
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You told me.
So you have information for me?
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Sorry.
Kill him.
Where is he?
I told him about your car.
Calls himself Dodd.
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Help me.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
Are you Teddy?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
Thank you.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
I don't remember.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Probably left it in your room.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
I won't be happy until you leave town.
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
That, and your thing.						   *
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Sammy didn't have a wife.
It makes all the difference.					 *
To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Doing...?
I was the kids' godfather.
"And" what?
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Yes you do...
Make it 35.
Okay.
It goes very fast.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Later!  Do you dance?
Exactly.
Cost less.  That's the point.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
Why?
Really?
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
And what do I do with him?
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Nothing.
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
This is Agent James Fujima.
Okay.  What's up?
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
How will it stand up?
Sonny...?
Where's Riccardo?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
...and thanks for the flowers.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
What would you do...?
Meaning...?
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
I ain't sleepy.
Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Yeah, well, so?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Get down -- where?
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Where?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
You want to split your hernia again?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Stop shitting me, man!
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Oh Jesus! 
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
But didn't have heroin.
Something like that. Cigarette?
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
What do you mean?
What's that?
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Where is it?
Yeah.
After we're outside the kogus?
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Max - where?
Oh shit.
My passport!
Who?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Oh, man, there you go again.
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
The kid's with them!!
Go!! Just go!!
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
I pull.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Manny...
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
No, there's...
I was just late.
Susan, we're not b-
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
That's camouflage...
Try not to sweat?
Peter...
We can do it!
Gross. What is it?
Fuck! It broke the skin...
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Sure.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
Nothing.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
My pleasure.
Well, I hope you like it.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Show me the way?
I don't know.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
--not fair?
I'm telling you, I can't.
I said that?
What?
Yeah, yeah...
I think you're right.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Why would you lose me?
It is.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
What? What is it?
Oh, I like that tone.
What is it?
He's your client, huh?
Maybe you can, Libby.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
Great.
I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
Not possible..
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How do you that.
I suppose I did.
What else?
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
What are you talking about?
I knew where it was.
More like two-two point two million.
What are you talking about?
I'm not ready!
How much longer before you can reach him?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Damn, you're beautiful.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
I'd like a little more conviction..
Then feel better!..
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Just about..
Affirmative.
Oh Ethan!..
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Like?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Twice.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
I'm fine..
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Nyah still on the property?
Good job.  And thanks.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
We got it.  On your feet.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Roger that.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
What happened to Jim?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
You don't think we're going to make it.
You didn't have to.........
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
This stuff is so sticky.
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Like Job?
Let's move!
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
- and picked us up in the States -
I remember..
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
And get a doctor.
But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
And a lonely ass.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Connection denied.
No, I'm going.
Yes.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Ti amo.
Again?
What killed him?
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
I won't come.
Let's go tell your Mother.
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Loretta.
Yesterday.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
I was dead, too.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
Don't just become excited.
She didn't like me.
What did you do?
What?
I'm in love with you!
I can't!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Yeah.
You're late!
I was.
No.
No.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Maybe you're right.
Bobo, take the cart away.
I don't understand.
On the floor?
Seven-thirty.
Where's the ring?
It was a miracle.
Did you see it?
You gotta date?
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
You're kidding?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
None of your business.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
I'm too old for you.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
You see that moon last night?
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
Yes!
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
What do you mean?
I'm not interested.
We don't have a lord.
You don't vote for kings.
NI!
NI!   NI!
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
Now - go!
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
So be it!
Had enough?
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
I'm thirty-seven.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Well ... I AM king.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To find the Holy Grail.
Here's one!
When's your next round?
I dunno, Must be a king.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I think I could pull through, sir.
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
I'm ... your son ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
No, not anyone else - just me.
What?
No, It's nothing!
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
No, no, we must find the Grail.
Don't say that word.
Look.  I'm warning you.
I didn't.
No, no, no.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
How about yourself?
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
You watch your tongue.
You know nothing about her!
Aye.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
I hope to go up next year.
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
She's busy.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
It is quite late enough.
Aye, do.
Yes.  I do.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
Quite.
Aye.
I am.
She's well, too.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes, ma'am.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
I heard something.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
The question is, do we need her?
I hope he got his mother's permission.
Who?
Excellent!
No, she wasn't.
Whom?
Just them?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I understand he was in a fight.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
No.  I shall be out walking.
I have no idea.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Your Majesty --
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
How'd you know it was us?
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
What the hell does that mean?
Yeah...
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
We are talking...
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
Laurie's.
My house.  I want to try something.
Nick, what is it.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
No I'm not...
Dante's Inferno.
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
Yes I am...
Got it.
And then keep on driving?
The game will guide you.
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'll speak to someone.
Sure.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
I was afraid of that.
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Before what?
Diane?
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Not that I can see.
Maybe it's not me.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"Then they'd put you in jail."
Good luck!
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
And who are we auditioning for today?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Could be unrelated.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Making ends meet, huh.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
We have to climb up that.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
Give me a fucking.....
I'm leaving.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Not listening !
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Yes.
I work here, remember ?
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Are you hunting wabbits ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
Ow...
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Thank you, sir.
Son, let's watch the tape.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Then what do you want ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
I can see that but where ?
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Yes.
Hi. I brought some wine.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Wake up, we're in trouble.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Which one, this door is locked !
We made it !
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Come to the rescue again I see.
No.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Oh, just put it over there.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Don't mention it.
Me, I'll know!
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Of course.
Have fun.
Totally groovy huh?
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
No.
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Does she?
I'll try.
I've got something better.
oh.
But I wanna write about her.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
What difference does it make?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
And I thought I was weird.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
This isn't just a mood ring.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Big deal.
What do you think?
He's an undertaker.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Was Rose.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Bye.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
This is it I guess.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I was commenting on your hair.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Is there milk in them already?
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Hey! Oh look.
You have no idea.
This guy bonking you?
What?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
What Hurts Vada?
Pardon?
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I wrote that.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
It's nice.
Did she ever see Vada?
In ages, I know, me neither.
Yes.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'll second that.
Perfect.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Then who's it for?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
You never cared before.
Soon honey, soon.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
Hi.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Nothing, I'm dressing.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Will you tell her I came by?
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
For this class?
I wrote a poem too.
Oh, Vada...
Why do you think she says that?
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
He likes her.
I am.
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Uh huh.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Aarrggh.
Hi.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Goodnight.
Liverpool?
I can't, I have to go home.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
I'm trying.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
For their meat.
Then go home, baby.
No, I'm hiding out.
Not true.
Like they do on TV?
Part of being a New Yorker.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
Desperate.  To talk.
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
No, he's ruining yours.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
What do you suggest?
It's too late to start over.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Gold nose hair clippers.
I just don't want to freak him out.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
... that this is all my fault?
... unless he has a hump.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
... Thomas, yeh.
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
What's next?
What, leaving school...
I never eat when I'm serene.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
If you like.
The night we met.
Well.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
And your point?
Well, it happens.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
To him.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
You're much more his type.
I know that, Star.
I see.
She's going to rest now.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
What!
Whose?
ABC.
Okay.
Bill, he's a crazy man.
To the bathroom.
She's in Paris.
Not yet.
I'll just be in here.
Harvard?
What is a turkey shoot.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
A little. What do you need?
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Well, he's really amazing.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Do you carry door handles?
Bet the sheets are grey.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
When I was little, in church.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
He's a member of our congregation.
Linnea?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
I've got a gig tonight.
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
Oh.
Oh.
Fifteen minutes?
You sound different. Is that really you?
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
Money's no object.
For him?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Did it break?
Just a minute.
What?
Where are you from?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Who?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be dammed.
When ya had it, did ya like it?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
You been followin' the news coverage?
What?
Not good.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
All right, Mickey.
Let's do it.
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
That's indescribable.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
On average forty million.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Unfortunately, yes.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Just for fun, I guess.
That's my opinion.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
Rockin'!
How 'bout Mallory?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Okay.
Slate it.
How so?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
What are we talking about?
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
See Duff. He's the money man.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Where was that?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Name's Duff.
Guess I don't.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Okay.
Oh yeah? That's good.
You work around town?
No.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
No thanks.
What is it?
That's right.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
'Been up north?
I didn't know you had one.
Okay, I guess.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah, that's so.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
We can always do that, Duff.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
'Round town.
'Got a good thing, man.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Who're you?
Okay.
I heard you.
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Okay.
Guess it's never been easy.
Thank you.
I guess I ain't.
I doubt it.
It ain't in me.
Oh yeah?
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Hi.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Right here.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
How's the villa's security?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
What about McCoy?
It's Case. Remember me?
What?
Can you take me to it?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
I don't know. I don't know...
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
Couple of months.
So you're a wire junkie.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Put the gun down, Case.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
What went down between you and Riviera?
...And if I guess wrong?
What is it?
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Shut up.
Thanks.
Petty good.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Right. 7:30.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
YOU KNIT?
If you say so.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
That is lingerie.
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Transitioned?
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Five-- Six--
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
Kristen got a quote?
Have you been there?
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
But I'm not a penguin.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Is that true?
No. Josie, this is real.
I know.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
To put us back together again when we fall.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Oh--yikes!
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
But now you don't have to--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I just can't look at you the same way.
Why?
Who are you guys?
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
For this.
No.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
Can't you make other creations?
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Who's Lisa?
Oh, come on Dad...
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
He's dead, you bitch.
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
Yeah, why?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
Only the wet ones.
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Yeah?
Who?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
What's this?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
yeah, I had a bad night.
I'm not hungry.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
'Morning, honey.
You okay?
Okay, I guess.
Okay...thanks.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
First door up the stairs.
Can't it wait till morning?
Deal.  Thanks.
No, she's right.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
He's close...
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
It's an amazing gift.
Sure.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
Can't be good news coming from you.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Didn't get much sleep.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
Sorry.
Sounds like a rough time.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
So do I.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
For what?
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
No...
Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
This is stupid.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Where...here?
I'm delighted.
Now you're lying.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Well, they can be.
Films mainly.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
No thanks.
No.
No.
I forgot my bag.
Thanks.  Well...
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Yes.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Okay.
What did you say?
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Come in.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Well, get a message through to him too.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
You have a stunt bottom?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
You and every person in this country.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
You do?
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Thank you.  Shall I...
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
What's the thing?
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
I haven't decided.
And this is William.
Anna Scott?
The movie star?
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
In a depressingly asexual way.
Tony -- what do you think?
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
And we intend to use them!
Working with Leonardo.
Well, thanks, that's great.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
Yes?
So it could have been neither of them?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
I think you do, yes.
That's not fair.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I believe I have.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
So -- any messages?
Two?  That's it?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
And she's in your house.
And you get on very well.
Why not?
Three.
Yes.
I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Oh sure.  Of course.
Fabulous.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Who? Tell me!
No! No! No!
Will you come with me, please.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
No way.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
No, it was irresponsible!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
O-o-o-oh...
Go ahead! Go back!
Ca-na-da...
Wow! They're so quiet.
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Where ya goin', Mac?
Huh?
Shhh...
My feet hurt...
Your buddy is callin' ya.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
What for?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
With your own two hands?
No!
No!
No!
What's he talkin' about?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Yeah, Mac?
No. Me! Me!
Hold it!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Time out!
Because I quit breathing.
How much ya wanna bet?
Shhh!  This way!
Sure...
Okay. Who else?
'Kay...
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Come an' see.
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
You an' me, Chief.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
He's in charge.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Big man!
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am,
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
No, she wasn't my sister.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Why?
What for?
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
Let's find a telephone.
Yes.  We did.
Your great aunt.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
But, Faith--
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Hm.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
Who's this?
Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Mickey Spillane?
NO.
Hi.
Oh.  That's nice.
You too.
What?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
You aren't?
Well.  Congratulations.
Are you asking me out?
In that case... no...
GET OUT!!
What?
I would call it-- unforgivable.
There is no us.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
He's a podiatrist or something.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I know.  You're right.
It's a coincidence.
What about your job?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
He fell out.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Sure you did.
Like a detective.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
I know, but...
My God... you're right.
When you could've found one in America.
Uh huh.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Went to high school with him. But...
He missed me.
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Terry... Terry... .
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
None of your business.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
Man, you were a mess!
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Do you like pigeons?
I don't know.
In a saloon?
Hit me again, Mac.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Who is he, Pop?
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
Down to the wire?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
Easy. Easy, boy.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Gimme.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
You want to know somethin'—?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Keep Charley out of this.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Be careful!
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
What can we do against them?
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
A situation easily remedied.
A symbol, Master.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Thank you.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
She's coming with us.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Uh-huh...
Now you're talkin'.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
I saw Karen Sisco.
Yes, she did.
Half for doing what?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
Jack --
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
The manager's door is metal.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
There a problem, Foley?
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Let's go outside and talk.
I thought everything.
In my bag, in the car.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
I thought so, too.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Nothing.
Who was it answered the phone?
And your gun.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
That's not what you were about to say.
To warn her about Chino.
I don't think we should get into that.
Why are you mad?
You just did, for Christ sake.
I see better with them on.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
I don't know...
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
For a time.
Hejira.
Like what?
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
I <i>was</i>...
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Thanks.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
What're you doing at Glades?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
No?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
It's possible.  Why?
No.  Course not.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Well, I need that...
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
Red...Strange?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
He did.
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
What facts are those?
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
I'm out of fuel!
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
Home of the Brave.
I can't make it.
You were more like brothers.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Well...sure.
Thank you, Sir.
Bombers.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
Have the planes made it to China?
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
Peggy Sue!
I'm not telling.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
How do you like my hair?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Peggy Sue!
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
I can't. It's all too much.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
On what?
Just what you underlined.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Thanks.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Save it.
What am I going to do with you?
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
You're going to listen to me.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
What about Janet?
Oh, God, Dion.
I'll never give up.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Okay.
I wish she hadn't.
But I'm remembering the future.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
What are you shooting for?
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
Can we split now?
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Open it.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Please don't shout.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I don't feel very festive.
What does Charlie think about that?
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Rosalie Testa!
You have an incredible memory.
But accidents can happen.
What was?
It really wasn't that difficult.
I	know what a burrito is.
What's inside?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
Give me some credit, will you?
Come on. You can't be serious.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
It's been a few years.
I'll be fine, Dad.
I'm going out, Dad!
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
You think he'd believe it if he did?
Right here, Mom...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
Sorry...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
I said, don't worry about it.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
A reaction to AZT...
One hour!
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Maybe you should think about it.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Don't do this, Andy.
About my blood work?
He's upset, he's sorry.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
They sabotaged me.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Let's find you a drink.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
What have you prayed for?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
What happens?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
I suppose you could say that.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Sure thing.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Gay movies.
Yes.
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Really?
Absolutely.
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Is that a question?
Yes.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
We were satisfied.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
It satisfied me.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Get a life.
Not especially.
Duh...
Probably since she was born.
Okay, Joe...
That's perfectly clear.
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
How did you do that?
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
Helloooo...
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
Charles...
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Entered our minds.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Had it with deals.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Saw something I didn't like.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Hey, who?
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Only around humans.
Probably right.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
What?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Company's not here, is it?
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
There is no "safe."
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Say that again.
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
About the girl.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Just the same, I want one.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Right now, if you like.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Yo!
But how long is a day?
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Him.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Let's take a look.
My name is Taylor.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Read it yourself.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
I don't know.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Shhhh!
A hearing.
Which one?
Maybe not.
Why not?
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Like you, I find it difficult.
He doesn't know.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Fuck you bitch.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
Barnes comes from Hell.
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
I got one...
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
...don't feel like it either.
Nah...
What are the heads?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
I'm supposing.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
How do you do?
Just drunk enough.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
I don't.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
You didn't have to tell him that.
I didn't notice him.
All right--following me.
Nothing matters.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
They'll look for you.
This must have cost a fortune.
Frozen.
That, and the fun of it.
That's right.
Including Killaine.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
You were there when I last saw him.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Very ridiculous.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
Sometimes.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Who's Goble?
For two hundred?
Why not here?
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
Yes, I've seen it before.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Doesn't answer the question.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I don't think you locked your door.
He saw my face too.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Floater?
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
So it seems Sergeant.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
I think so.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Such as?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
I'll take your word.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
That's not very kind.
What does it look like?
Years, why?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Very good.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
I see.
Hello.
...break away completely from--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Why not.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
To the airlift.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
The Argies.
Let me see.
You're so gross.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Yes, finally.
Yes, you said.
No.
U-huh.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Oh no!
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
De nada.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
You gotta earn trust.
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
There's nobody else here...
Yes, sir.
That's the point, isn't it?
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Nothing.
I need you to teach me.
I'm serious.
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
What are you talking about?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Like the old days, Dillon.
They're getting better equipped every day.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
No more games.
Right behind you.
Anytime.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
It's been a long time, General.
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
There's no sign of it.
He knows our defenses.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
He's not really my uncle.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Please, we hardly know each other.
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
You've got a lot of nerve.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
You're making the right decision, sir.
How?
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Sure.  For five bucks.
The price just went up to ten.
Not exactly.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
For an hour.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Do you plan everything?
Oooh, thank god.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
"Occupational hazard".
No shit.  They expensive?
I sell them.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
All right, two thousand.
Done.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
You're forgiven.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Television?
I have work to do.
Good.
Dinner can wait.
No.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Huh?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
You just did.
It was a business decision.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
We're letting them slide?
We just did.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Rent.  You're late.
Kit give me nothin'.
I leave extras, miss.
Vivian.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
Of course.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
Of course you will.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Gently.
Did you say, "I do"?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Anybody want a peanut?
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
If there are, we'll all be dead.
It's you.
But you don't know where he is.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Over the Albino, I think.
I'll be right back.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
-- offer me money --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
Thank you.
Again. Thank you.
Tell me.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
I will. And I choose --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
An hour.
Have fun storming the castle.
A little bit.
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Congratulations.
"Of the silvery moon,
"I want to croon,
Do the books!  Do the books!
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Only if we ask him.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
Yes.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Nice girl.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.

"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
I mean in show business.
We won.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
What?
Of which morning?
Or arrived with her.
Anyone at home?
Someone is sitting in that window.
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Who are you, friend?
Sam, if she's here...
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
And the police haven't been able to...
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
No.
An hour! Or less!
Why can't I go out there with you?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Bates never denied Mary was here.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Can you?
No.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I'd like to.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Norman.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I'd like to, but...
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Then I'm free to go...?
Now what?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
He's already been.
Arbogast.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Haven't any.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
From what?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Maybe you want my money, too.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Well, news of Buckley?
Yes!
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I don't agree with you.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
I'd love to, at any time.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
What do you think I am?
It happens that I'm the law.
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Nope, I'm through!
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
We'll grant that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Who'd steal her body?
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
You go in for dangerous things.
That is unfortunate.
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
You're insane.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
That's the physicist's playground.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.

So I can move on.  You too.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Nobody.
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
Good night, Rose.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
He did?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
I don't want to know...
Well, yeah.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Okay.
At least.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
What?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
She will succeed.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
What?
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
She has other things to do, Dave.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Illusions, Madam?
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
What and?  That's what I got.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Lay off once, would you?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Stop blaming yourself.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Yeah.
Entertainers don't count.
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
Same day as before.  I think.
You don't smoke.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Nope.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
There probably is.
You going rogue on me?
I... I think I can... clarify...
What?
It's our job.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
Sounds good.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Keep 'em busy.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
Who are you?
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
We got separated.
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Ahhh...
Charges!  Come on, come on!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
You, too.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Come on! Come on!
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Your Royal Highness.
Oh, no.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
I will not fight you.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
On my mother's grave.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
For you.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Weiss.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
A decision had to be made.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Oh my, my,
Like I'm outside in the rain
Free to try and find a game
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
The delivery boy.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
...No thanks.
I think he might be worried.
I don't think I belong here.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
What're we going to do?
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Paul.
Don't talk like that to him!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
...Thanks.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Does that bum have to say that?
Move your shoulders down.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
...Ten minutes.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Bob.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
...Fine.
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Yeah.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Do I have to pay juice?
Gonna try.
...Thanks.
No -- Just me.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
...Yeah.
I said, how ya feelin'?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, Kayo.
Ya puttin' me on?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Yeah.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Ya got heart.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
...The guy's great.
Fine... That guy's great.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Ice skate.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
...No.
Gazzo's a good man.
...People talk to me more.
Maybe --
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Well, I'll be...
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
A tweeting bird?
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Ask her...
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Toon cops worked me over.
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
He's right here in the...
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Eddie, come on.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
I've already seen your photographs.
Divorce?  Never!
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Yeah, that's better.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Me.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Good idea.
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Then I'll leave thee.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Romeo will answer it?
Why, what is Tybalt?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Of love?
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
She'll not come down tonight.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Well what shall I swear by?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Right.
Is she a Capulet?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Who the fuck are you?
And who are you?
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
I thought I did.
That's him.
You lose them!
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Is that right?
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Ready when you are...
There's a problem...
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
You first, Edvard.
I think not.  After you...
Bad company...
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
There's been a slight problem.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Enough!
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
That's it.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
Eat shit and die slowly...
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
No thanks.
Coordinate what?
That's what I thought.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I wanted to see who you were.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
I just wanted to see something.
Gregor's cell phone...
A lot of people died.
But you can't.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
Right now?
So I do it.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
Finish the job...
What?
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
Gonna be tough.
Why didn't you kill him?
I might know where you could get a copy.
The Russian would be easier.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Cash and what?
Never heard of it.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Torch it?!
What's that?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
I...I can't do that.
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
What are you thinking?
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
He killed her...
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
I might have to look into that...
Hi.
Nothing.
Are you sure you're OK?
I love you too.
He's not, he's...
Great...
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
What did he buy?
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Well I just uh, you know...
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
So be here at three.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Dwayne -
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Anything in it?
We're going to find out.
What do you think?  Heart attack?
I'm not getting an answer.
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
What??  Where'd you hear that?
I'd like to see you try.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
El Capitan?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
This won't take long.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
I am a tourist.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
IT IS CRAZY!
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Excuse me?
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What is it?
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
No mu-shu.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
No.  I'm going to find out.
What?!?!
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
Amen to that, brother.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Just trying to make it look real.
How do I know I can trust you?
I'm fine.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Baby Duck?
Thank you.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
So was I.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
No.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
Witnesses.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Come on!
Good God, ya'll!
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
I am from outa town.
Oh yes.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
The Feds?!
No...what?
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
It's called a dress.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Or somethin'.
Nobody touches me.
What are you talking about?
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
You have what I asked for?
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I was trying to find the right time.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
Thank you.
And what did you say?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
"Make the shot."
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
You're coming here?
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Tootaloo.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Looking for Maggie.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
We think so.
A pre-wedding luau?
He is not!
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Seven-fifty.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Highly suspect.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Of course.
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Yes.
You humiliated me!
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I love you, too.
Well, you do have the dress.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
It's probably because you got him fired.
Why?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Quick.  Very quick.
No.  It's my life.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
Yeah.
He's got a houseboat.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
What is it?
Does it have wheat in it?
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
-- it was a betrayal.
At the top of the Empire State Building --
What?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
I know.
I always wondered about that too.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Is this crazy?
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
A sense of humor.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I know. 
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Walter and I are engaged!
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
What?
Magic.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Have you had any relationship since?
It's hard to imagine.
It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
I don't know --
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
You think so?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
What is it?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
-- a slice of pizza --
Whose show was this on?
Go to sleep.
Is that what she used to sing?
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Not now, Jonah --
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She's going to cook something for us?
It's only ten o'clock.
No.
It's a short word.
Victoria? She's okay.
Who is Annie?
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Are you going with her?
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Shut up.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Okay.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Hi.  Sam?
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
You look good yourself.
You did?
You could have called me --
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
That's none of their affair.
How's it going?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
It never ends.
The woman question?
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What has it got me, your union?
Antonio paid for it.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
Hunting.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
What are you saying?
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
What attitude?
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
That's it?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Everything go?
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
This man sounds like a real catch.
Why not?
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Never heard of him.
Like you?
This has nothing to do with him.
What is wrong with you?
Therapy session is over.
It's me.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
Ass first into the world.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
It's Tom.
Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Sorry.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Can you set that up?
I think on account of his nose.
Yes, Jimmy.
Wait till I tell you what it is.
When? When did you ever see me use?
I can't tell you.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Why do you say that?
Okay! Okay!
Yeah.
Yeah, dickhead.
You go, boy.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Yeah.
My name is Tom.
To who?
That would be me.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Again, I thank you.
And you've got wiener breath.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
What do you mean?
Maybe he isn't showing.
What is it, drugs?
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Spit it out, Captain.
Figured.
In West Fork?
The Army gave you that?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Of course, sir.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
You know classical music?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Did he see any sign of them?
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
You don't count.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
What about Talbot?
PUSH!
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
I think you're right, Keith.
You're welcome, John.
Yes, sir.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Sure, Reiben.
There's always a bright side.
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Ours is not to reason why.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
What if our guys open up, sir?
I coach the baseball team, too.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Yeah?
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Excellent.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Lloyd, give it up.
Lloyd.
C'mon Lloyd.
That's just so embarrassing.
Okay, I got it.
I admit nothing.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Alright.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
I'm fine.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Swear to god.
No, but you stole from them.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Alright.
No, I read it on the message.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Well, not monumentally.
Hmmm....
That's cool then.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
What?
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Yeah.
You're shaking.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
It was wonderful.
No, we don't have to say it.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
No.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Klaus Tauber.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
You're kidding.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
I pay you too much.
He's important to my business.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
Yeah, I can.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
That's great.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Things are great, things are great.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Pistols?
So I'll talk to him about it.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Something they can hold in their hands.
Do what?
Christmas presents.
Are you losing money?
What other point is -
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
More.
Stern.
They're withholding payment.
No?
There will be generations because of what you did.
You did so much.
Would it do any good?
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
They've broken their pattern.
I won't.
What? I can't hear you...
I'm losing you.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Where is everybody?
What if I said you?
No, it's me.
I live here.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Finish what my son started.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
No, it's not.
No. This is a set up.
Good question. You took the bait.
But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
Until now.
Just for you, Sid.
What are we looking for?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Let's find out.
No, wait here.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Yeah, right.
I'll give you one guess.
You're pretty when you're angry.
Are you in danger now?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..harmonica style is okay.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We got free tickets.
Shush.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
He's after me.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
To see your reaction.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Absolutely.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
No.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Oh shit it's my cell!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Need to get in that building?
There a story in that building?
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Huh, fine.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
W-what do you want?
How do I know their voices are --
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Who the fuck is this?
No one's saying you did.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Oh...
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Now that it's out of your system.
It's okay. We need to talk.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Are you serious?
Do I?
To apologize.
Really? What?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Guess.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
I believe you...
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
That all depends on you.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Answer the question and I will.
What?
Deputy... good evening.
What kind of lead?
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
What were you doing out here?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
What is it? Where's Casey?
The phone's dead.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
What's the delay?
As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
What's your favorite scary movie?
So who are you?
Can you knock?
Twice.
Don't shoot. It's me.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
I can cry on cue.
Like you had one.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Why are you doing this?
The official term is "psychotic".
Do they know who did it?
It's past seven.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
I don't know, they just did.
I did. He's full of shit.
Give it to me.
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
I'm in.
So what?  This victim...
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
I read about it in the paper.
Where was the girl?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Hello.
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
It's not too far away now.
Why?
NO!
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
What the fuck is going on?
Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
No one yet.
Good.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
What?
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
No.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
Call an ambulance.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
I don't know... like fifty.
You got to be kidding.
We're focusing.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
We need a warrant.
We had him.
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
When do we get to question him?
I will.
It surprises me.  It really does.
He mentioned it.
Did the wife confess?
I don't know.
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Just keep goin'...
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Sir?
Grab hold!...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
Because she's my...my...
What's that?
He just couldn't wait...
Scar?
Cut it out, will ya...
Look?
How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Never heard of him...
Not likely.
Not no more.
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Not far from it...
No...not yet...
From the beginning...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
We got two around that age...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Do you have a better idea?
You?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
What?
Someone from the village.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
I haven't the slightest idea.
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
You don't remember?
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
But what is the truth?
Just call me Elisabeth.
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Tenth floor.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Right you are, governor!
Writer, is he?
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
No Juliet?!
Romeo
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
Put his feet in.
Cut his nose off.
A share of the profits.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Who are you?
It is all locked safe in here
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Who wrote that?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
I did not.
Tomorrow
What do we do now?
How will it?
How goes it, Will?
Burbage says you have a play.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
Be still.
I am not so well-born.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Stand up straight, girl.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
I have lost my gift.
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
"Ay me."
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Is she obedient?
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
I have to get back.
Who is there?
The same, alas.
Oh, not for the world!
There is.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Orsino…good name
Nor you for me.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Virginia?!
But why me?
I will do my duty, my lord.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
A theatre poet?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Is this necessary?
I don't know.
Security.
You're not eating.
Looking for you? Yes.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Yes.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
What?
Yes.
Really?
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- which is a hack.
Yeah.
You're right.
David?
His car's still there.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Did what?
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
And now you tell me.
You were magnificent.
Who was it?
Then let's spend some money.
It tastes different.
Don't you?
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Oh, good.
And the money?
No.
You're frightened.
The perfect couple, I should say.
What about?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Someone lost the key.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
You're sure of that.
Did you ever kill a man?
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Sorry?
Exactly what I was --
Would you like to see the rest?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
Did he sound upset?
You know about it?
The first one was fine.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Yes, but... I thought...
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
What do you expect me to do about it?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I don't know. Just a minute...
I hope she's all right.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Uh-uh.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
Her?
Yeah.
No thanks.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Why?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Yeah.
Great.
She is.
Well, yeah... you know.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
No, thanks.
Yeah, I think so...
And what?
I just have to do one little thing.
I won't screw you up.
Did I what?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
No you didn't.
You were great.
Sammy's?
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- mmm --
Mmmm --
-- we are?
Lester's on his way.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
No --
It's too late...
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Don't go, Jackie...
Don't leave me...
What for?
Wanda...
-- Oh my yes.
-- how did you get here?
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Who?
You said somebody... who?
George, I don't --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
What?
Do you really mean that?
Yeah, baby.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
When I get off work.
Who?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
What did you say?
Thank you.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
Thank you.
Oh yeah?
What about her?
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
What?
What do you mean?
George is going to open a shop.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Fine.
Aren't you going to have one?
You know what's wrong.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
I'll call you.
So what's your point?
I guess not.
Don't be silly.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
I'm exaggerating.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Sure.
-- never mind.
-- no.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
No, it's not that...
-- we're going to be here all night.
Where to, Les?
Yes?
You mean they ate each other up?
Do you feel bad?
No.
Yeah.
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah.
No.
Yes?
Yes.
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Do I have to?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Sure.
I'm a Wendy.
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Your money's no good here.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Yeah.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Yes.
No, nothing at all.
Yes, I did.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
I think he did it to himself.
Yes.
Jack...
Why?
Wendy!
Stop swinging the bat.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Wendy give me the bat.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
shut in together over long periods of time.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh, I'll say.
Hi.
Uncle Al-
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Sure, Uncle Al.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
What?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
What?
Yeah! What is it?
A tracer. You'll like it.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
What the hell does that matter?
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
What you say?
You know what we're saying!
Were you tempted?
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
With love.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You can handle this.
What?
Vince...
Today was the deadline, Vince.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Good evening, Vincent.
Joey -- do it.
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Oh my! 
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Why?
Just about.  Show me again.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
It's true -- I know her.
Pay attention...
Um, I don't really know this one...
I knew that.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
What?  What time is it?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
A novice.
What?
Now you.
You watch yourself!
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
We're nuns!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Don't you know it!
Very well.
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
You mean black people?
Would you like that?
Can do.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
A what?
No food?
Come, Sister.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
What do you mean?
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
Oh?
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Don't push it.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Get a stenographer.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I think they'd understand.
Oh-huh.
They open a window.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
Who are you guys?
We didn't tell you what?
Which one!
Which one?
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
She's praying.
Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Which convent was that, Sister?
He's decent.
But how do we get there?
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Find 'em!
Many have.
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Excuse me?
To place it inside its coffin.
... Brom Bones...
You will stay at her side?
What of it?
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
They need guidance.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
Not for lack of trying.
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
How could he?
Up.
The Western Woods.
What kind of nuts?
I have others.  All I need is this.
Father said witches live there.
Listen.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Man or woman?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
In test... what?
What does it mean?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
What troubles you?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
And, what did he say?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Yes, actually.
The Horseman.  Yes.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Doctor, he is awake.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
No.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
How are you, Bill?
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
You have any biscuits for sale?
French-fried potaters.
Karl's my name.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
What?
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
Would y'all like that?
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Childers.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
What numbers do you punch?
Childers.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I reckon I feel all right.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
You told me to come by.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Why did he do that, reckon.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
If you want me to.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
He ain't no count.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
I reckon.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
Mama?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
You better go get 'em.
Yes sir.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
All right then.
Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
Ma'am?
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
No, we have to get this story.
No thank you.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Signs?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
I confess.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
I'd love to.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
What's the difference?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Not a peep.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Uh, better make it one.
You got it.
Ready. Any time you are.
Yeah, probably.
Eighteen and a half years.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You don't give up, do you?
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I almost got married once.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
I think I'll take them. 
What can I do for you?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
And you told your nephew about it?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
In Manhattan?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Yeah, I can believe it.
Drawing's a good thing.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
How long have you been here?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Are you going to be all right?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I don't know. For helping me out.
You don't really want to know.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Come on, just a little hint.
The inspiration.
No way.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I just did.
Is it yours?
And started to run.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
Carl Heine's type.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
You don't.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
A thousand.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
Those aren't the facts that matter.
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
Tht was summation, Your H...
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
He didn't want to lose any more.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
Have a look.  At nothing.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Maybe...?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Obviously.
Sure, anything's poss...
I already said that, b...
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
He had no reason to.
I can't speak for him.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Beat it, Buster.
Thank you ever so.
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.

It's private.  Go away.
Those two musicians from the garage!
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Hey, Joe!
We're not too late, are we?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
Shave our legs, stupid.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Polish?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
Fight it.
Good night, Josephine.
But this is so humiliating.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
Daphne, you're bothering us.
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Security.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Like what?
Like right after the ceremony.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
I may throw up.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
We're not on the pier yet -
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
Stay as long as you'd like.
Interesting.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
You got some?
Half-full.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I may spill something.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
I guess she's not in here.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
I met one of them.
I hope so.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
You like it?
Me too.  Bye now.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Sorry.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
Why?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Oh.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Every time!
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
What's in Florida?
You're entitled.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
Who are you?
Not very likely.
Not at all.
Up, up, up.
What theory?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Shells?  Whatever for?
I am?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
You mean you can't fall in love?
What happened?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Talk about sad.
Have you ever tried American girls?
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
Me?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
I know.  Every time!
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Go where?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
You and who else?
I already told you.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Why, with you.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
And you do now?
Doesn’t look like nothing.
I have regrets.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
I don’t know.
You’re too good for him.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
It’s cute.
Shampoo, got it!
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
I’ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it’s the words: “morally repugnant.”
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
Thank you.
Therapist.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
That's where we come from first?
What he talk 'bout?
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
Yes, mam...
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
No, Miss Johnson...
Yes mam...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
What happened afta that?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
Goodnight to you, son...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
Sunday...
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
David!
I don't look like no possum!
Goodnight.
Same as we -- they pray.
David, come back here!
You sure can, son...
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Yes, ma'm...
I'll walk...
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Tired.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Mornin'...
Little chilly.
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
Is there something I can do to help you?
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Montana.
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
Very funny!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
I saw him last night!
We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
And she's getting worse...
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Whoops.
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
No way.
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Okay.    Not.
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
It's... It's not good children.
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
You bastards!!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
-Or monkey fucker-
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Huh?
Oh.
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
What is Terrance and Phillip?
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
You would know, dummy.
Terrance! NO!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey, come here, guy.
I know.
Hey, relax guy!
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Hi Stan.
Cool!
And the butfor?
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh Sara...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
It certainly is.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
It's a little late for you to be up.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
You better start making sense!
Taylor, you surprise me.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
I know, I know.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Why can't we?
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Wait.
Ready as I'll ever be.
Sure.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
I can't!
Taylor!  Where are you?
Over and out.
We have room!  Let's go!
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Is there anything I can help you with?
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Baby, take it easy.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
You're not from around here, are you?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
It belonged to my dad.
He's my dad.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Lemme see your ball.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
It was a clearance.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Wait! That's an aria!
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
I'm not on the tour this year.
They suspended me for 100 years.
That game was before you was born.
Thanks.
She's my mom.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I gotta survive.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
He says that to all his wives.
I am underground.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
I found dad.
Cool!
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
Buzz Fazeli.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Yippy!
Coming right up.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Won't your father help you with that?
Not while I'm in training.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
More than you could afford.
We would have sooner or later.
I feel sick.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Back away then.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Two and a half days?
But she's --
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Now!
Captain.
Storm?  What storm?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Geologists?
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
I don't know.  That's the point.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Working on it now, sir.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
They're coming.
In a minute, sir.
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
The what?
He understands me fine.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Radiation shield, you think?
What do you make of this?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Sir, about leaving --
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
That's quite a secret.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
What -- are you threatening me?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
Yeah, why?
Beth.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
You went through Edmunds' things?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
Squids?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
But why is he doing it?
Sintag.
Bingo.
You want to kill him?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
Your watch.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
No, he can't.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Don't you know?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
C'mon --
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
In time for what?
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
We can refuse to talk.
I'm not being defensive.
I'm fine.
To what?
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Am I?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Harry?
What happened to her?
Help me lift her.
Shut up and open the door.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
You got her?
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
No, they didn't say --
Captain who?
Really?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Who's everyone?
What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Please, Ted.
Why's that?
Not that I know of.  Why?
I'm not sure.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Who's going to pay me then?
I'm beginning not to like you.
Is that good or bad?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
You mean we should go after her!...
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Did it occur to you they might find us?
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
What are you saying?
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Why didn't you say so before.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
What about it, Diz ?
Yes, sir !
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Only when I give you an order.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Excuse me...!
You're upset, that's alright.
Yeah.
Your turn...
Who ?
Excuse me...!
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Carl can wait.
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
How do I know if this is love ?
I can't help it.
Shhh...
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Hut... hut !
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
How come we never got together ?
Sure.
You saying you didn't ?
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Teenagers !
I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Courage, I guess.
You can never be sure.
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Yeah, that's right.
Move out.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
What is it, Rico ?
Good for you. Go find out.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Yes, sir.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Give'em hell, sir !
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
The information will not be disclosed.
<U>Answer</U>!
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
You are what...?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Mr. Decker... ?
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
I am seeking answers, Captain.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Why did you quit?
It's in your play.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
Yes...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
Mmm.
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Why?
Then I'll come back, then.
I used to go out with a politician.
Go you Huskies!
<u>Please</u>...
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Hi.
Going home.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
It does?
You know what else a man can do?
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
I'm going to tell the truth.
...I'm sure that people are upset...
Water or mineral deposits.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Courthouse back in town.
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
And I need a drink.
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
We've got three days to...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Of course he...
You have to what?
It's night.
There's other things to be learned.
The Mayor's outside.
Who is it raped you?
Why?
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
I just...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
We, we have to give it.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
The minute I read that script I said...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
Yes.
I can't tell.
She won't stop crying...
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Later for you, pal.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Yes.
He should be put in jail.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I know you do.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
Where have you been...?
You want me to lie.
I'm out.
I have to tell the truth.
So be it.
For what cause?
I don't...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
That's what I said.
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
We don't have the money.
He's got a gift for fiction.
...not the Lazyboy...
Sherry, Sherry...
And we're glad to have you here...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
It takes all kinds.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
I don't care.
I hate when you say that.
Excellent point.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
I live.  In the same country.
Like a big sister.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
She is but an arriviste.
Great.
Don't. Take me with you.
I'm not.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Honey, she won't d...
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
But Rache...
Annabelle put down that camera.
Cos she loves you.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Where are you, anyway?
Yes.
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Rache says it's from you.
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
You think I didn't get that?
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
You're WHERE?
Not to me.
WE are over.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
I did it for her.
Anxiety.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
We can't live like that.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
You're not dying.
How the hell would you know?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
And you said...
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
Oh please.
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
What do I have that you don't?
You're the hip and fresh.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
They don't hate you --
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Yes, Mikey?
Yes.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My Jesus…
My baby.
My grandchild-baby.
He's dead.
Poison gas.
He wasn't.
I am sure.
I know!
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
I dunno.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
What's tomorrow?
Huh?
Oh. What happens now?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
The same.
OK!
Hi, Dad!
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Say, Ni...
Again!
Great!
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I don't think so...
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Oh.
Y-yes--
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
What do you think?
Yeah?...
What happened?
You're going to pay for this...
I don't want any...
He's in there...
What do you mean?
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Excellent...excellent!
I say we head out.
If I don't get power up we are!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Moffo!
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
I know nothing of the sort!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Didn't they tell you?
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
That's government property, Major.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
Yes, sir.
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
Just a squirt.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
How many planes did we lose?
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
What?
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Seond safety.
Hell, he looks dead.
Quentin, how's your gear?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I don't get you, King.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't anymore.
Intense.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
What did you guys think?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Yes.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Yeah, when's he coming?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
What?
Yes!
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Okay, okay.
No.
No, I'm not worried.
No, I mean, no one.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Erica is in the van back there.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Jeff! Let's go!
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Shit.
In what way?
Buff is funny. God.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
I can come visit?
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Are you talking to me?
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Please.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
No, no, whoa!
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I could.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Okay.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Oh, yeah?
Let's see.
Oh, sure.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
It does look good.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
No.
What?
Oh, shit.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Just go home, alright?
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
That's right.
Look, look, just get off my property.
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
What? What do you stand for?
Tim!
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
I would've stopped it.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
No, no.
I don't know.
You do.
Jeff!
No. No, no, no.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Well, what about us?
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
What?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Look at you!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
Mine too.
Mm-hm.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
You do?
Really? What else does your mother say?
Where do you get your ideas?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Don't do that, man, okay?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Yeah.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Hey, Tim.
Come on, Jeff.
No car.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Look, it's really not my fault.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Bye.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
She thinks you went to the police.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Jack...
Trix...
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
That was gas, Sweetie.
Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
That you?
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Hold on...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Definitely old.
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
But you're not married.
Bank branch!
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
My what?
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
More proof God's a guy...
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
Action! The scene starts.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Are you hungry?
Phillip, you're mad!
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
Life can be beautiful!
You did?
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
So long.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
It will?
Who's who?
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
It must be my new shampoo.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Whose house is it?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Come on, Joe.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
December twenty-first.
Where do you live?
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
I don't need a tuxedo.

Come here!
Just follow me.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
A little.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Why do you say that?
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
No, they don't.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Wipe your feet!
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
She is upstairs.
Right with you.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
What car?
No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Who?
This is the staircase of the palace.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
It's what we were warned about.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
You love me?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Tell me where I can find her.
But why?
But I don't understand.
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
She has hostages.
I'll come back as soon as I can.
Hmmm?
I did.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
A passionfruit smoothee.
I'll drink to that.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
You vicious--
Can I quote you?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Oh, no thanks.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Oh, sure.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You bet your ass.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
It's going to be a tree, I think.
Can you create life?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
I'm Linda Lee.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Throw him out.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Criminals.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
I knew it!
Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Zaltar!
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Brad.
Brad Wilson.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
Clark.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
Too much mayonnaise?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Uh-huh.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
What!
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Say!
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
Gus Gorman.
Yeah.
Thirty-five.
I know, I'm the fault.
What about this week's check?
Who gets it, the company?
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Decaffeinated too?
That what they call you?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
We've already got some.
What will it do?
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Sister! I'm his sister!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
I didn't have my camera with me.
We've already met.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Diet soda?
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Turn on the light.
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Why do I have to do this?
Missing????
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
We already have a super-tanker.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
Where did it come from?
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Don't bet on it!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Lois, you're amazing.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Say you love me.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Uh...home...
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
It's beautiful.
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
What about here?
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Don't worry, I've got you.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Like me?
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Daddy . . . ?
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
. . . And  very naïve!
Who?
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
You're just an experiment, freako!
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
This wasn't in the plan.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Destiny.
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Albert!
One of them should've been you.
What's she doing in California?
I know.
North. It's north
No.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Unbelievable.
Huh?
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Don't you ever give up?
Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
You're not the only one.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
First the pets, Otis.
You think he's for real?
Tough guy, huh?
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I read the article.
Bingo!
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
La de da da...
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
I'm wearing it.
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
All of us.
-- as we will be.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
You've got me? Who's got you???
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Uh-huh.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Very much.
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
We'll see how fast I can fly.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
Billy, that's too early.
When the game's over, I guess.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Yes.
And they loved Bear.
For rabbits?
Did they give him special care?
That would complicate things.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Yes.
What is it?
Is there shrimp on it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Well, let's see what we get.
Excuse me?
Do you have this agreement with you?
Yes.
You remember that much?
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
It's okay.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
No.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
But Charlene...
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Alone or surrounded?
Thanks, I see him...
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
Who said Sidney?
J.J., Steve isn't...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Can I come in for a minute?
Not just this minute, J.J....
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
I didn't say that, J.J.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Are you finished?
Get Steve back his job...please...
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
No, I won't...
Don't go wild, Sidney.
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
What about?
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
What sort of thing?
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Nothing...
Why not you?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Yes, but why?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Why did you call me?
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
What chip?
Let me try mine.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Liquid metal.
Max.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Cool.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
No.
Drive faster.
Remember what I said, you can't...
Yes.  Throw it in.
I have to go away, John.
Gimme that Phillips right there.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
Why him?
Why attack Russia?
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
Yes.
But I promised your mother.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Some.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
and totally irrelevant.
With more what? More what?
Not yet.
I have a duty.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
Three months.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
No!
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
And what did he say?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
What?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
So. You wanted to see me.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Yeah?
His private life?
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes.
You're late.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
I thought you did.
Right.
I don't understand...
The what?
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
You like it?  It's my first.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
No.  Never.
Kyle...
Of course.
Who is in authority here?
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Okay.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Like shit, boss.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
Did you?  Kudos.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Please, don't do that...
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
It was an accident.
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
I don't know... he fell.
A game?
What are you talking about?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Never mind.
You first.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
They'll love that.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
I think not.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I thought...
I don't...
Wha... ?
Get out of my car!
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
... what... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Claire.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Big family... small?
Studied acting, I assume?
No.
Why?
I'm going to call.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
Stop it!
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
Yeah.
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
I hope.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Like, this way... sort of...
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
Is there a room key?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Ilsa... you're alright?
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Nothing else?
You're joking.
Sam...  Thank you.
You warm my heart.
Who's Watts?
Why?
Do we still get paid for the week?
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
All night?
-- how much is this car worth?
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
But there's a sad catch to the story.
That smell... oh, God.
In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
Nell.  You will come here now.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
No --
Test it.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Why'd she kill herself?
Fifteen dollars.
That's why we're here.
You're okay.
Well?
I don't know, you know...
I think so.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Then what good is he?
It's not a knock.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
We think?
Why not?
Not bad.
There's been some trouble downtown.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Round about, yeah.
Huh?
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
He's gotta know why.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
What post office?
Not much -- you?
Probably.
Really.
No, but I know what he means.
That's not what I heard.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
That's what was estimated.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Depends, don' it.
I'll bloody well ask him.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Eh?
And that is?
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
You bet.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Are you finished?
Ah.
I don't.
Yes, Ann?
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Boy.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Ah... it's nothing.
Huh.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Birdy--
Uh-huh.
Well? How'd she do?
I don't understand.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
Maybe.
Cash.
Sure.
It's OK.
Look, uh... Creighton...
Mm.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm.
Come on in.
So you paid the guy?
Just coffee.
How are you?
What happened to you?
You don't have to tell me anything.
It was Big Dave's.
I don't know. I don't think so.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Oh, hell. Drink?
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whuddya mean?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Yeah--
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Could you come with me please?
Ah.
Not an owner.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Homicide.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
No.
I appreciate that.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Calm down.  I found it!
Let's go!
Like hell!
Call me Vince.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
So the method of death is the only connection?
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Apparently it's huge.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
You're right.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
We will.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Read it out loud.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Footsteps!
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
What is it?
Get back!  Now!
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Where did you see it?
All right.  If you're positive.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
What?
<i>Fiji.</i>
One.
Today.
Thank you.
A window onto the human condition?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
You think she'd go through with it?
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
Now.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
You think so?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Your Dad?!
Who?
I told you I can't.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I don't know--
You hate gambling.
So why do you want to go?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
Who?
There's no one here.
Yup.
Working with?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
You can't.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
Your guess?
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
What's wrong, Scully?
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
No.
I was until about an hour ago.
Get dressed, Scully.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Mulder --
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Yeah...?
I don't know.
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
About the conspiracy?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Lucien Baines?
No.
Okay.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
No.  No.
What happened?
Do you think that's funny?
Peter, okay?
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
What difference does it make...?
Okay, okay...
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Mocky-Lock.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
I need you to find something in the basement...
That hoist, with the winch...
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Yes.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I don't have to.
Considering where I've been...
Do you understand German?
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Yes.
He was Harry's driver?
In German?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Tell me more.
Anna.
It's just what he used to say.
I thought you wanted...
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
I don't know.
Why?
He told you, didn't he?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Oh...
How did you know I would be here?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
Of course.
Thank you.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
I have never seen him.
It wasn't important.
It's true then?
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Just around the corner.
No, not yet.
No.
Best thing that ever happened...
It wasn't petrol.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
A bruised lip.
Thank you. Excuse me.
I see.
No.
She's right. It's none of my business.
You all did.
All right, Calloway. You win.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Oh, Mr. Martins...
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
No, a major, were you really?
Of course, of course, of course.
Why not?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
What do you want?
Here?
What did he say?
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
In great pain?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
You saw it?
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Funny?
Not necessarily.
Why no, Mr. Martins.
Help you out?
Just take it, OK.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
We moved rooms because of him.
That's the wrong one.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
We're ok.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
Hi there. Here, take a look.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
He's an asshole.
What??
Who the fuck are you?
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
You want it to be an event.
Killing himself.
That's stupid. Why would they?
You can't.
What do you care?
That's stupid.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
How would you kill him?
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
A poison...?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Female...
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
What were you, following me?
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
A forty-five.
You're lying.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Daniel Balint.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
I've got to get back to the --
The mother.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Why me?
I can tell....
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Do I give a shit?
Valentine...
Yes.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Italian is practically the same thing.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
Congratulations.
Italy!
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
What does that mean?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
The rules are the rules.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
No...
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
... For the mermaids.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
... I'm listening.
What is it?
I don't want to erase anything.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
You say that because you have the title!
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Who?
No... in the hut.
... Okay.  I'll try.
I don't know... why?
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
Uh... Yes, of course!
I did?
It's me... Johana.
I got fired.
... Not at all.
Absolutely positive.
Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
No.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
No.  I'm just depressed.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
Yes... It's magic.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Yes Esther.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
He's still working out some identity issues.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
That depends. How much money has he?
Nice fellow?
I drink.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
Let's get in your truck.
Where? Where did you find it?
What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Who?
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
That's right, of course.
About Charlie's leopard?
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
Thanks, Sheriff.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
You. Us.
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Can it be that you want your brother found?
What... What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Excuse me?
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Have you got a pen?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
My brother hung himself.
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
...We’re turning in circles.
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Get to the point, will you...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
The dead can wait.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
Yeah.
No. A poor little rich boy who thought he’d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Yeah.
I see. How much?
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
I’ll call again.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
Recommended?
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
My rates...
Anything at all?
Is my money in there?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Yeah.
Have you?
I’ll be alone.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
How are you, Rhian?
Should I be?
Good reasons?
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
Uh-huh.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Could that be Camden Market?
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
Then why don’t you reach him?
The acid bath?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
That's a good idea, sire.
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Well...
Yes...
Jeanne, no...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
But... why... what's the point?
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Good.
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I don't know...
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Quite a few.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
We want her burned as a witch!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
Where... where am I?
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
No no, I'm fine, really...
What about you?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Last night.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
He's on the other side of the river.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
We need another ten minutes...
Not yet.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
Yes.  We can pray.
Perfectly.
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
The clothes are not important...
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
I... submit to Our Lord.
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Don't swear...
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
What do you mean, they won't come?
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
So your memory's coming back?
Really?
What are you doing on the wall?
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Why did she have to die?
Wladek, please.
He'll be here soon.
Just over a year.
What's happened?
What?
It costs.
Who told you?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
That makes a change.
Just shut up.
Yes, but what good did it do?
So, what's the news?
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
Not this week.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
Watch his hand
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
I don't want to learn.
No.
You mean in signs?
No, not words.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
I just want to listen.
He chopped it off
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Shove off, Duff.
Forget it.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
Who's got the contract?
What do ya want the others to get?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Then you'll do it?
What do ya mean?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
He threatened to kill me.
He'll show.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Pass.
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
The name is Lonnegan.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
But I got a train to make.
Think nothin' of it.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
What the hell for?
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
I am after this race.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
For fifteen years.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
No.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
I'm sorry.
That is, if it's all right with you.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
There!
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Disappeared!
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Which way did she fall?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
A new invention?
It's a promise?
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
You mean about that gun?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
He did!
Did you go?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
No.
All right.  All right.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Don't you remember....
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
No.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
No word at all?
Well, don't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
They'll want more than your word for that.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
This is your party.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
Oh, this is Andy --
That last Martini.
Take it easy.
We need ice.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
At breakfast.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Want a drink?
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
Who's that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
I don't know.
It's the only way it makes sense.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Police!
No... no.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Baghdad.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
Move!
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
Maybe we should split it up now.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
He's an enemy soldier.
It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
I out rank you, that's why.
What if I do?
Suppose I don't go for that?
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Knock it off!
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
We leave it.
Mine.  Land mine!
I heard it click.
Just relax.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Jesus, Jaeger.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Yeah.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
You sure you want me too?
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
Shi'ites, I think.
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
The...the gold...
Thanks.
How the hell should I know?
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
For real?  A treasure?
What?
It doesn't mean anything.
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
I think we found something.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
He lived through that?
Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Correct.  Origin?
Permant cortex bond.
4732...?
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
What's the matter with you?
Now.
Look,dirt!
That's not food.  Can't be food.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
No!  Don't go.
Don't take anything.
But...you...
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
AH UGH.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
THX and me.
Where is LUH?
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
Look!
No, I...
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
What do you want?
I can't understand.  The sedatives....
Go ahead.
Hang on.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Mike Reilly.
Where...?
Yep.
Look, it's a longshot...
What?
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Where you guys at?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Me, too.
Off the scale.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Hey, I'm next.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
We've created a monster.
Thank you.
Alex-
Take him!
A ticking bomb...
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Nothing so far.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
I don't know...
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
That feeling won't last long.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
The type they marry.
Smart. London, eh?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
I hope so, too.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
I know it!
Good day, Doctor.
No--no.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Gaston Monescu.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Lily-- 
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Oh! You didn't read it!
Do you realize I have light eyes?
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
No. What is it? Tell me.
As you like. 
Yes!
You think that's too much?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
And so will M'sieu Giron.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Together.
Talk? About me--about us?
So you think you can get me?
You're conceited--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>believe</u> you.
No--thirty-five! 
Divine ...
Yes, madame!
Please!  Thank you.
Well--uh--yes and no.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Well, he was in the navy.
Well, where is it?
The pumps --
An hour, two at most.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
She knows.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Not the better half.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
Bollocks.
No, but we're making excellent time.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
If only it were that simple.
She had beautiful hands.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Jack, I --
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
To the stars.
This is crazy.
Could it have damaged the ship?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
We'll find out.
I can't feel my body.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
You think she was really there?
Would you like anything?
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
How'd you ever get away with it?
This is Miss Marsh.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Will you leave me alone?
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
<U>Gladly</U>.
We'll be expecting you.
Not at all.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
You work too fast for me, young man.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Okay.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
Sally--!
Lonesome?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Lose?--I won a little--
What do you know about them?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Now you're talkin'!
You take some awful chances.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
What is it?
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Think again--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Swell!
O.K.! Send that!
So what?
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Yeah--
Is this your gun?
Are you happy?
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
What do you mean?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
So what?
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
The country boy's about due.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Why?
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Thank you.
It all depends on what you're used to.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Beauty, ain't he?
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
This brand.
No...
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
I was kidding about that.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
I'll remember you said that.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All right.  Then what?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Not half as bad as I feel.
I don't.
Good God, you're really-
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
I know.  Me neither.
Colorado's closer
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
I didn't mean it that way.
Wyatt...
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
I'll be damned...
What're you talkin' about?
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
Morg, use your head.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
So why did you leave?
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Do you?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Fishing?
Hey - the world is my office.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Happily.
Thanks.  Take care -
Let's not make it a habit.
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
What do you mean?
Up.
Are you listening to me?
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
I understand.
Sabotage?
I am. What do you want?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
You leave me no alternative.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Excellent.
What's wrong?
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
My timing always was lousy.
You come with me -  You stay here.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
It's Bond!
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Hush.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
What happened to your hand?
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
You should go back and rest.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Hattie is a different person now.
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
He is in his pigeon cage.
No, I haven't seen him.
Where was the last place you left him?
Let's let Molly open one.
Rocky!  The ramp!
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Excuse me.
You can't!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
You mean that happy child?
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Trouble?!  Where?!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Where is it?  I don't see the --
Alright Buzz, get ready...
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Yeah, right.
Look out!!
Hold still, Buzz!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Heh-heh.
Murderer!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Have you been replaced?
Toss 'im overboard!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
I can't quite make out -- 
Huh?
What?!
Right here, Woody!
No, Slink --
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Home is where the heart is.
Go away.
H'm?
We're too young.
Juliet who?
He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Why are you talking like that?
What is he being charged with?
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
Carl --
Me, too.
No, not yet.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Not yet.
I don't know.
Just watching you.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Yes.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Who do you work for?
I don't know.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
Yeah!
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
So you pay off our customs officials?
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
I don't believe you.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Who?
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
I feel like a traitor.
An informant.
What is it you want me to do?
But will he be house-trained?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Noriega is a criminal.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
Just tell me where she is.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
You've stabbed me, man.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Did you bring the cards?
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Thanks.
I'm going home.
It's where I live.
No, not holding hands.
Certainly not.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Sixteen next month.
It's an interesting theory.
Now?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Another dab?
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Lewis Gilbert.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Are you serious?
Well, it's up to you.
you'll need one more hit.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Such as?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
That's fair enough.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
My pain?
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Pavel.
A Federation starship.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
Have the Klingons responded?
It's all I have.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Are we leaving, Captain?
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Yes, Spock?
Yes.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
What do you mean?
Damn.  Let's go.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
I have a half brother.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
That's a little vague, Spock -
It must be all those marsh melons.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No conditions.


Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I cannot go with you.
I belong here.
Senior exec.
I know, I met him.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
To warn him.
Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
I'm certainly not.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Not a chance.
Let's get outta here.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I'm sorry -
The Pentagon?
It can be arranged...
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Where did you hear that name?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Greetings, program...
Yes.
Alan-One...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Come here.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
End of line.
Do it!
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
That's all going to change, Yori...
I had to...in the games...
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Where are you going?
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Fine.
Yeah, right.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Yes.
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
What?
Will you just open the door!					*
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
Stay on him.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
You want me to just hang-- ?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
It can't be.
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
Sorry.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, sir.
I agree.
It's certainly... dramatic.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Yes what?
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
I'll handle it.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
Do you still love your husband?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
Sure, hon.
I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Yes.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
No.  Much more.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
Go ahead.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
I understand.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
I don't know.  I have to think...
Hello, Alabama.
Wait a minute -
He wants to speak with you.
Knock wood.
How come?
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Don't eat anything.
Get it.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Want some Goobers?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Sure. Why not?
Would you like to get some pie?
How 'bout me what?
What do you want to know?
What's your favorite color?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Five.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Uh-huh.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
You don't know him -
What?
How come?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Can you live with it?
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
You goin' out?
Good for you.
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Elliot Blitzer.
What's to think about?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
What are we gonna see?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
Do you still have friends on the force?
I'm your son.
Nope.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Step inside.
Sure. No problem.
Absolutely.
Or a supporting actor -
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
You do.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Pussy love pink rocks.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Exactly room-mates.
I didn't mean -
You're still a little... disoriented.
What are you going to do with us?
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
I need to go now.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
You wouldn't understand.
It's so clean.  No germs.
I have to go.
This is April, right?
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
No more drugs.  Please...
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
What?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
James, why don't we...?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
Shot!  Who shot you?
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Might be tight.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
That's 'cause he's dead.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
More or less.
Same back at you.
That's my morning's pay.
Will be.
It is not.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Time.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Hundred-fifty.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You've been there?
You believe that?
What?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
I want my car.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
Yes.  Yes it is.
Who the hell is this!?
I'm just going to my car.
Thank you.
I guess it must.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Those are white words, not ours.
Come here.
Games?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
No.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
From?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
Not me.  Us.
You killed him!
Just drive.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Now what?
I'm here.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
A lot that means.
John Stewart.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I do.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
And tell her what?
You didn't kill her?
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
Come on, Jake--
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I said come on!
For what?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Oh, shit!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
I guess.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
And you're taking?
You want something?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Christ no!
I said I was sorry.
All right, old man.  Christ.
That's 'cause he's dead.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
You know I won't be seeing you.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
That's a solid name.
An overheated car.
Like you don't know.
About things.  About your wife.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
It's not what you think, Jake.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
What are you talking about!
You're too quick for me.
Will you shut up!
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
So?
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Open up!
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
Do you have to call me that?
You should be more careful.
No trouble at all, really.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
Like you.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Walk away.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
I'm sorry...
Yeah.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
No! You get it!
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Bobby? Are you all right?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
How much?
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
No baby, you got it wrong.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
They look nice.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
No! No! Please!
There's someone in the house.
I said come on!
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Four.
I have a lock on the door.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
You assumed wrong.
Is there a problem?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
We are.
What's he look like?
I want to sleep here tonight.
I won't make any noise.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
Just one--
I'll help you.
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
I lied.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Okay.
How long have you been married?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Innocent of what?
She back in Kansas?
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
He admit it?
No?
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Uh... Duke.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
I could of... easy.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
What happened, did you hit him?
You missed him? You didn't...?
Tell me right off if you see him.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah.
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
You ain't shot.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Yeah?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Well, she...
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Beats the hell out of me.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Yeah... you said that last night.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Tom?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Yeah?
Plenty of times.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
And ?
There's more.
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
They'll never stop.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I don't want to know.
I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Then who goes?
What do you care what he says?
Can we stealth these guys?
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
Tough break.
Well, I'm sorry.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
We'll see.
You're lying.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Who is he?
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
You know damn well what I think.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I'm not a rat.
Right.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Why lie about everything else, then?
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Nothing.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
Gruber...
It looks that way.
What does it mean?
Yes.
I was her doctor.
Yes.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Tell me one?
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
I am seventy-four years old.
I'm on the staff of...
Yes.
Yes.
I . . ..
You've just said you signed it.
Hold on a second.
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Yes.  I wrote it.
Yes.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
... and you're going to do that?
Why?
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
No.
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
...things change.
That happens.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
The TV didn't work.
And are they going to get it?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
It's over!
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
No.
Right.
I can't talk now.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
We got to talk.
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
You live in the neighborhood?
Mrs...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Well?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
What about?
I want to know who you are.
An hour?
Okay.
Tomorrow morning.
I'll take care of you.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Judy --
You can.
Yes. Yes, I do.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Oh, yeah. There.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Madeleine died here.
Take me away...
No! Let me go!
Yes!
Your accident...
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
At...
This afternoon.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
My name is John Ferguson.
What?
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
What?
Good-bye.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
I don't like them.
Only silence. It's always like this.
What?!
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Yes?! But --
No, never!
And it's a all real.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Madeleine!!
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
Why?
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I've never run across one like that.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
What.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
That!?!
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Do you know him well?
Nothing to tell.
Think?  Well, what do you think?
Carlotta?
Oh... this and that.
Wandering.
How?
But you said grey, sir.
Excellent.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
First of all...
You're not a team player.
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
And you're a little fucking reject.
You're a loser.
I'm not getting a ticket.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
We've already done this.
I don't give a damn.
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
Don't ever stare him down.
I know and I'm honored...
I know...
What happened? Oh my God...
I don't think so.
I got you.
So where's that leave us?
Sweet deal.
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Who's up for making some real money?
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Shut up.
Good God...Good God...
I'm talking about prayer.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
He's having a problem here.
He is not cracking up.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Suck my ass.
I'm serious.
Not a prayer.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Moore?
You hate women.
You have a King fantasy.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
I love you.
Why what?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
It's vile!
With all my heart.
Honey I don't have the time...
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
I'm mad at you.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Okay.
What!
Well, can you come back inside?
Are they fighting?
Do you love me?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
It's too late.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
What money?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
You did all right dad.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
Buzzing?
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
What is it?
Did he try to kiss you?
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Take your time. I wish I had.
So where to on the honeymoon?
That's our plan.
It was an accident!
I don't think that's a good idea.
You'd like me to kill them?
Two.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Come down.
Evil.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Yes, sir.
She won't even know.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Nothing.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Why?
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Stop this!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
A black bull came.
He couldn't get through the door, then?
You little liar! Get out of here!
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
Yes!
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
I've had a gutful of this.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
I'm getting by.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
I've seen worse.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
This is supposed to be years away.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
That's not true, Parker.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
You like baseball?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
Part of him is.
...I think so...You?
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
It's <u>producing</u>.

Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
...can we have a white one...?
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
He's not fine.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
I'll see you at National.
The American "people"?
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
Why?
What did Albania ever do to us?

Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
...Stanley Moss...
The War is Over.
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
Quite touching.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
...how ya feeling, boy?
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
To preserve their Way of Life.
I have.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Why Albania?
...going to War...
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
...it's a Teaser!
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.  We wouldn't have him <u>say</u> the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked <u>in</u> to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way <u>past</u> it, we're <u>past</u> it -- it's the set-up for...he has <u>got</u> to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... 
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
All the greater accomplishment.
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
Might, if I was asked... 
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
Get on your feet, boy.
They'll be here in ten minutes.
A proud tradition.
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
Take ten.
...what is this?
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
The special hats of the Special Anti-terrorist detachment of the Border Patrol.
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
Better.
A beret.
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Please, no thanks... 
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
What are you doing here?
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
What? How do you know about my father?
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
...Gordon.
How much?
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
Excuse me.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Upper West Side.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
And what do you want?
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
Why?
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
With Mark?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Yeah, yeah, OK
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
About what?  About us.
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
That's not what you said last night.
Maybe before the event, never after.
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
I'll come back all the time.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
So much.
Do you really think so?
Mm-hmm.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Yes, but...
Almost.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
Um...yes.
Who?  Your husband?
I can't, no, no, I can't...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
Wait!  Don't go...
And then you weren't there.
No.  No, I don't.
It's fine.
Of course.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
She's making this up.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Jody, no...
What?
I don't...
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
The planchette?
I don't know.
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
It's alright.
Jody, she's alive.
Hartford?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Why?
No.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Like what?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Norman Spencer.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
I am, really.
I know.
More or less.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
Is it gone?
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
You are so brilliant.
Did you call about the Feurs?
Huh.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Harvey says he's amazing.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
We had a seance.
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
I...
In the living room...
What's wrong with me?
Yes.  The ghost.
...Please stop...
STOP IT!
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
It's alright.
She can't be here without me.
You don't have to do that.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Then you wear it.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
Always loved you..
Explain this to me --- violated...?
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
I know.    you are my son -
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
What about you coming down here...?
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
That's GREAT!
Mm-hmm...
That's not funny.
Lock the door.  Lock it
A bit much.    Lucas.
Go ahead.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
BRIAN...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
That's right...
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Sure...
Where do you kill them...
No she didn't...
I don't know...
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
I have something I have to show you...
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Did you?
Nothing could be better...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
Yes - I suppose so...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
No worries
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Yes - of course.
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes - one please.
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
Were you always this sick?
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Perv.
Not ever. Never.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
These are real, live women?
We reinvented ourselves.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
But that smile.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
We own a small family grocery store.
Dad, please.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
It's okay. You need me?
Got it.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
Everything.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
I'm trying to help.
"Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
You never know around here.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
He didn't. He had it built.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
Eventually you'll let go.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Not a chance.
Maybe someday.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Rules are rules.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Thanks.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
She still work there?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
I understand.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
The skinny brunette.
Lombardo's settlement?
Unless what?
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
Where's Lombardo?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
So you were alone.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
You didn't cuff her?
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
I think we just need to get wasted.
You're out of your mind.
Hi, Mon.
Whichever one I want.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
In back of the garage.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
So you got my mom's money.
About six and a half million dollars.
Hello.
Duquette.  Forget him...
That's not your line.
You think that's wise?
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Jim West.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Put them all together and what do we have?
Is this leading somewhere?
Starting with a screw?
What about the explosive?
Almost?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
It's not a guy...
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
I adjusted it.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Of course not.
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Yes, me!
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Your guests, ma'am?
I've had some practice.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
You bring the best out in a man.
Fine, I'll stop.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Nicely said, sir.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
He had a pressing engagement.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Yes!
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Let's go.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Say what?
I have no family.
He's no magician.
Of course!  I promise!
Where the hell did you come from?
I thought you had her!
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
You?
Who?
Willow!
Ahhh!
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
No!
No.
What do I need for that?
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Why?
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Who??
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Maybe milking.
Sorry. It's important.
No pistol. Ever.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Oh, he's good.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Move! Or you die right here!
We do not go into your courts.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Home.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Only the elders.
Two days.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
I know.
Aren't you? After today?
I hear you.
Not yet.
Yes, thank you very much.
You didn't have to...
His name is John Book.
I know.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have to help him!
They don't have any shit.
You might have killed him!
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Yes, darling.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
I don't believe you!
Ohhh!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Hickory!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oh, no -- no!
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Oh --
I knew you would!
You've had plenty of time already!
Lions and tigers and bears!
No, but you tried to.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
You're right -- I am a coward.
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
But why?  Why?
Huh?  What'd he say?
Ohhhh --
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Ohhh --
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Where's Kansas?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Did you just hear what I just heard?
Leave her alone!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
It did?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
What's the matter?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
Fine.  He's got a plan
Imposserous!
Yeah --
Not nohow!
To Oz!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
We'll get you together!
Oh --
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Go on!
Well, I --
Well, I --
But I still want one.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
So isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Who?
Renard.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Yes.
Yes.
It’s the only way out...
I have to go to work.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
Not interested.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Someone will come.
How would you know?
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
What?!
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
You're the only human being I care for.
Cured, yes.
Jon -- what??
Veidt¹s complex.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Okay!
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
We should get back --  What?
I don't know their real names.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
What does this mean?  What does it --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Ever see one of these before?
What is that ungodly smell?
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I'm from L.A.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
We'll have to go after them.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
You can't talk to it?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
Is this what you're looking for?
When else are you gonna do it?
Of course.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
Beast.
For what purpose?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
We have to find Magneto.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
What's that?
You know, you --
What if I like the pain?
Suit yourself.
He takes his work seriously.
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
How?
Enough for a test.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
The way what is going to be?
Yes, my dear, he is.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Yes, don't worry.
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
That's my good boy.
May I have it, please?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
This is the only library I know of.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Break that old man's violin.
Yes, sir.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I beg your pardon?
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
I'm sure we will.
How do you do?
Yes, just the two.
What hump?
Why are you talking like that?
Fro-derick!
Just putting up some tea.
What?
I have a pretty good idea.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
... I'm glad that's...
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
What did you find out?
What???
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Is everything ready?
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
What a filthy mess.
Well, this explains the music.
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Me?  Sing?
Not fooling around.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
And I have mine.
MMmmm.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
